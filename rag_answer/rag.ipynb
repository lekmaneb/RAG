I thought\\r\\nher the most beautiful, wise, and wonderful person in my world, outside\\r\\nof my home. I treasured her smiles, copied her ways, and listened\\r\\nbreathlessly to all she had to say, sitting at her feet worshipfully\\r\\nwhenever she was near; ready to run any errand for her, no matter how\\r\\nfar.I measured other people by her principles and opinions, and always\\r\\nfelt that her word was final. I am afraid I even corrected my beloved\\r\\nparents sometimes when they failed to state some principle or opinion\\r\\nas she had done.When she came on a visit the house seemed glorified because of her\\r\\npresence; while she remained, life was one long holiday; when she went\\r\\naway it seemed as if a blight had fallen.Her eyes were dark and had interesting twinkles in them that children\\r\\nloved; her hair was long and dark and very heavy, dressed in two wide\\r\\nbraids that were wound round and round her lovely head in smooth coils,\\r\\nfitting close like a cap, but when it was unbraided and brushed out,\\r\\nit fell far below her knees and was like a garment folding her about.',\n",

How I even\\r\\nused in secret to tie an old brown veil about my head and let it fall\\r\\ndown my back, and try to see how it would feel to have hair like that.She had delicate features and a wonderful smile. Nobody else in the\\r\\nworld looked just as lovely as did she. But once I found a picture of\\r\\nLongfellow\\'s Evangeline in a photograph album, in exquisite classic\\r\\nprofile, and thought it was her likeness. She was like that—if you have\\r\\nthat old faded photograph somewhere in an old album with quaint clasps.\\r\\nShe was wonderful!And she was young, gracious, and very good to be with.This radiant creature was known to me by the name of \"Auntie Belle,\"\\r\\nthough my mother and my grandmother, called her \"Isabella!\" Just like\\r\\nthat! Even sharply sometimes when they disagreed with her—\"Isabella!\" I\\r\\nwondered that they dared. I sometimes resented it.Later I found that other people had still other names for her. To the\\r\\ncongregation of which her husband was pastor she was known as \"Mrs.\\r\\nAlden.\" It seemed to me too grownup a name for her and made her appear\\r\\nmore stately and sedate than she really was.

She had another world in which she moved and had\\r\\nher being when she went from us from time to time; or when at certain\\r\\nhours in the day she shut herself within a room that was sacredly known\\r\\nas a \"study,\" and wrote for a long time, while we all tried to keep\\r\\nstill; and in this other world of hers she was known as \"Pansy.\" It was\\r\\na world that loved and honored her, a world that gave her homage and\\r\\nflowers, and wrote her letters by the hundreds each week.It was not long, too, before I had learned to preen myself like a young\\r\\npeacock because I \"belonged\" to her, and I am afraid I felt a superior\\r\\npity and contempt for the thousands of other children who read her\\r\\npaper called \"The Pansy\" which she edited, but who did not \"belong\"\\r\\nto her. They could only write letters to her, while I could often be\\r\\nwith her every day, sometimes for weeks, and could talk with her all I\\r\\npleased.As I grew still older and learned to read I devoured her stories\\r\\nchapter by chapter. Even sometimes page by page as they came hot from\\r\\nthe typewriter; occasionally stealing in for an instant when she left\\r\\nthe study, to snatch the latest page and see what happened next; or to\\r\\naccost her as her morning\\'s work was done, with: \"Oh, have you finished',\n",

And now we listened, breathless, as she read,\\r\\nand made her characters live before us. They were real people to us, as\\r\\nreal as if they lived and breathed before us.She was at the height of her popularity just then, and the letters that\\r\\npoured in at every mail were overwhelming.

Sometimes she let us help her when she was\\r\\nvery much rushed, but usually she kept her touch on every letter that\\r\\nwent out—and they were thousands.Then there was the editorship of \"The Pansy,\" a young people\\'s paper\\r\\nwhich was responsible for more thousands of letters from the children\\r\\nwho had joined the Pansy Society, and who wrote to her about their\\r\\nfaults and how to give them up, \"For Jesus\\' Sake,\" which was their\\r\\nmotto.Sometimes I look back on her long and busy life and marvel what she has',\n",

Perhaps she imagined it, but it\\r\\nseemed as though he had recognized her close proximity with a frown!\\r\\nNevertheless, she determined not to retreat. What if there should be\\r\\na chance just to speak a cheery word to the girl? She tucked herself\\r\\namong the cushions, drew her coat closely about her, and seemed to\\r\\nsleep, but she had never felt wider awake. Her nervousness was taking\\r\\nthe form of a premonition.The man had turned toward his wife. \"We may as well be comfortable\\r\\nwhile we wait,\" he said. \"It is beastly luck to have to wait at all.\\r\\nThese second class towns never have proper hotel accommodations. Let us\\r\\ngo over to that couch at the other end of the room where the pillows\\r\\nlook less stinted.\"The girl looked over at the distant couch then glanced back to the one\\r\\nwhere Mrs. Dunlap rested.\"Oh, no,\" she said, moving nearer to the fireplace. \"I am chilly;\\r\\nI would rather stay here. Suppose you push a couple of those large\\r\\nrocking chairs up this way?\"\"I can make you much more comfortable on the couch,\" he said, his tone',\n",
       " 'rocking chairs up this way?\"\"I can make you much more comfortable on the couch,\" he said, his tone\\r\\nindicating annoyance. \"That fire will not keep you warm, there is\\r\\nnothing left of it but charred old stumps. Do let me snug you up among\\r\\nthe cushions.\"He essayed to pass an arm about her as he spoke, but she drew away from\\r\\nhim with a wan smile as she said:\"I would rather stay here; it seems less lonely to be near a woman. Why\\r\\ndid we trouble about rooms? I think I would just as soon stay where I\\r\\nam?\"\"Standing?\" he asked in a tone which to the woman on the couch sounded\\r\\nsullen.\"No,\" answered the girl with that pitiful attempt at a smile, \"I would\\r\\nbe willing to sit if you would bring up chairs. There cannot be much\\r\\nlonger to wait, I should think. What time did you say we could get a\\r\\ntrain?\"When he told her, the response was almost a wail.\"Oh, Rufus! That was not what you said before? Why, that is not until\\r\\nanother day!\"The woman on the couch held herself motionless by a strong effort of\\r\\nwill. This was not the tone of a happy wife! She was certain now that\\r\\nsomething was wrong besides a few hours of delay. This was more like\\r\\nthe outbreak of a woman half afraid of the man who was supposed to be\\r\\ncaring for her.\"It is beastly luck,\" the man said again. \"Something is always the\\r\\nmatter on this confounded branch road! If you hadn\\'t been staying in\\r\\nsuch an out of the way place, we should have been saved all this.',\n",
       " 'matter on this confounded branch road! If you hadn\\'t been staying in\\r\\nsuch an out of the way place, we should have been saved all this.\\r\\nStill, I don\\'t understand why we should make it any more uncomfortable\\r\\nthan it is. You ought to be resting quietly, instead—\"Her voice interrupted him, louder than it had been before. \"I cannot\\r\\nrest: I cannot! I can only think of my mother\\'s utter dismay and—and\\r\\nterror when she hears—\"\"H-sh!\" The man\\'s sibilant whisper was sudden and fierce!No wonder the girl started, and cried out in fright: \"Oh, what is it!\"He bent over her and spoke lower.\"It is nothing at all, my dear, except that you are utterly tired out\\r\\nand your nerves are on edge. But you must be careful what you say.\\r\\nThat confounded eavesdropper has planted herself as close to us as she\\r\\ncould, and may get the idea from your words that I am a fiend of some\\r\\nkind. Thank goodness, though, she has gone to sleep, at last! I must\\r\\nsay they are taking an unaccountable time to get that room ready.\"\"That room!\" repeated the still frightened voice. \"There are two rooms,\\r\\nof course?\"\"Of course,\" he repeated hastily, \"but I could wait for mine, you know.\"\"I don\\'t like it,\" the girl said, quite as if she had not heard him,\\r\\n\"I don\\'t like anything about it! I wish—Oh, Rufus, can\\'t we go on\\r\\nto-night? Or go somewhere and talk things over and make other plans. I',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t like anything about it! I wish—Oh, Rufus, can\\'t we go on\\r\\nto-night? Or go somewhere and talk things over and make other plans. I\\r\\ndon\\'t want any room!\"He spoke kindly but with great firmness.\"That is impossible, dear, as you will realize when you think a moment.\\r\\nAll the arrangements are made, and my friend is waiting and will be\\r\\nthere for the next train. There is no other train until morning that\\r\\nwill do us any good. Why can you not be the sensible girl you have been\\r\\nall the afternoon and let me do the extra planning that this detention\\r\\nhas made necessary? I assure you I can take care of you.\" As he spoke,\\r\\nhe tried to draw her nearer.She made a despairing movement away from him and said:\"Oh, I cannot make you understand! I know how strange it seems to you,\\r\\nbut if you could think for a moment of my side of it! Can\\'t you realize\\r\\nhow different it will all be to me when I have the right to be with\\r\\nyou anywhere and always? As it is, I cannot help feeling strangely\\r\\nalone and—and almost disgraced! I do, Rufus, I cannot help it. Mother\\r\\nhas always been so particular about me; and she would think this that\\r\\nwe are doing was terrible! I know now that she would. Can\\'t we go\\r\\nsomewhere on the cars, and talk it all over? I don\\'t feel so perfectly\\r\\nstrange when we are moving. Hark! Was that one o\\'clock? And we were to\\r\\nhave been there long before twelve! And you were to telegraph to mother',\n",
       " 'strange when we are moving. Hark! Was that one o\\'clock? And we were to\\r\\nhave been there long before twelve! And you were to telegraph to mother\\r\\nearly in the morning! Oh, this is dreadful!\"He bent toward her and spoke gently. \"Daisy, listen, you are making\\r\\nyourself ill over troubles that do not exist. Everything is all right;\\r\\nwe shall be in by noon, and my friend will meet the train. Meantime in\\r\\nthe early morning I will wire your mother, as we planned; and—\"She interrupted him. \"But we don\\'t get in until noon! And what you were\\r\\ngoing to say won\\'t be true!\"\"Oh, nonsense! Why, my dear, if you were not so tired as to be beyond\\r\\nreasoning, I could convince you in a very few minutes of the folly of\\r\\nthat! I shall only be anticipating the truth by a very few hours in\\r\\norder to relieve her anxiety.\"\"Rufus, I cannot help it. I cannot have our life together begin with\\r\\nfalsehood! It is bad enough as it is. I cannot help being sorry that we\\r\\ndid not wait until mother had a chance to know you better. She is not a\\r\\nhard or unreasonable woman.\"\"I see plainly that you do not trust me.\" He spoke with such bitterness\\r\\nand sharpness that the listener on the couch who could catch only\\r\\nportions of the girl\\'s words, felt as though she would like to spring\\r\\nup that minute and defend her. But the voice rose clearer just then.\"Rufus! How can you say that to me? If I had not trusted you utterly,\\r\\nwould I be here to-night? If you had a mother, you would understand how',\n",
       " 'would I be here to-night? If you had a mother, you would understand how\\r\\nperfectly dreadful it is to—\"As she hesitated for words, a hotel official came towards them.\"Are you Mr. R. H. Keller, sir? If so, you are wanted at the office\\r\\ntelephone.\"\"Confound the fellow!\" muttered Keller. Then, in a gentler tone, \"Don\\'t\\r\\nlet that frighten you, Daisy. It is a business call that I have been\\r\\nexpecting; but it comes at an inopportune time, of course. I shall be\\r\\nback in a very few minutes.\"Left to herself, the girl walked back and forth in front of the fire,\\r\\nseeming to catch her breath in convulsive little sobs. She was so near\\r\\nthe couch that Mrs. Dunlap could have put out her hand and touched her.\\r\\nWhen that good woman saw a pair of small hands clenched and heard a low\\r\\nmoan, she came suddenly to a sitting posture and in a moment more was\\r\\nspeaking in a low tone.\"Will you forgive me, dear? I am the mother of a precious girl who was\\r\\nabout your age when God called her home. And I miss her so! I cannot\\r\\nhelp seeing that you are in trouble. May I not play mother to you for a\\r\\nlittle while and try to comfort you?\"But the girl\\'s face at that moment expressed such abject terror, that\\r\\nshe made haste to add:\"There is nothing to be frightened over, dear; this is a quiet,\\r\\nentirely respectable house, and your husband will be back in a few\\r\\nmoments.\" It was the probing word that this student of human nature had',\n",
       " 'entirely respectable house, and your husband will be back in a few\\r\\nmoments.\" It was the probing word that this student of human nature had\\r\\nresolved should open her way, and it succeeded.\"He is not my husband!\" the girl exclaimed. \"Not yet,\" she added\\r\\nquickly. \"We were to have been married as soon as the train reached our\\r\\ndestination; but the train was delayed; we could not go on; and there\\r\\nwere no rooms to be had without this awful waiting! I wish now that we\\r\\nhad not—\" She stopped abruptly, then began again.\"I know I must appear very silly indeed to a stranger. But I cannot\\r\\nseem to help it. And I cannot explain, either, why it should suddenly\\r\\nseem so perfectly dreadful to me, but it does! I am so used to\\r\\ntraveling with my mother; I cannot get away from the thought of how\\r\\nperfectly awful it would seem to her if she knew that I—\"The tremulous voice stopped again; and at that moment Mrs. Dunlap felt\\r\\nthat she could almost enjoy shooting the man who had deliberately\\r\\nplanned such a state of things for this frightened child. She passed a\\r\\nprotecting arm about the trembling form and spoke low and tenderly.\"My child, will you trust me and tell me all about it? You remind me of\\r\\nmy own dear daughter; I am sure that you have a precious mother. Does\\r\\nshe know that you expected to be married to-night?\"\"No, oh, no! She doesn\\'t dream of such a thing! We couldn\\'t tell her\\r\\nbecause she—she is prejudiced against Mr. Keller; he has enemies, we',\n",
       " 'because she—she is prejudiced against Mr. Keller; he has enemies, we\\r\\nthink, who are trying to injure him because he is a more successful man\\r\\nthan they are, and she—Why, she wasn\\'t even willing to have me walk\\r\\nout with him, alone! But I thought—I mean I think that when we are\\r\\nmarried, and everything is settled forever, we shall be able to make\\r\\nher understand. It really isn\\'t as though I were a child; I am of age.\"At this, the child-woman drew herself up with such a pitiful attempt at\\r\\nwomanhood that Mrs. Dunlap, under happier circumstances, felt sure she\\r\\nwould have asked how many hours it was since the child had attained to\\r\\nthat dignity!The tremulous voice continued:\"Still, I could not live without my mother; and I do not need to, of\\r\\ncourse. As soon as she discovers how truly good and noble Mr. Keller\\r\\nis, and what a devoted son he is ready to be to her, it will be all\\r\\nright. Mother has always wanted a son.\"A note of appeal had crept into her voice as though she longed to hear\\r\\nfrom even this stranger an assurance that all would be well. Mrs.\\r\\nDunlap\\'s mother-heart bled for her, and a throb of thankfulness for the\\r\\nabsolute safety of her own daughter thrilled through her. With it came\\r\\nthe determination to do what she could to help this girl, even at the\\r\\ncost of a possible mistake.\"My child,\" she said, \"I feel that I must tell you something that I\\r\\nthink you ought to know. You are registered at this hotel as \\'R. H.',\n",
       " 'think you ought to know. You are registered at this hotel as \\'R. H.\\r\\nKeller and wife!\\' And one room—not two—is being made ready for you.\"FOR a moment Mrs. Dunlap regretted her words. The terror in the\\r\\ngirl\\'s eyes transformed her face; and the low cry she gave was almost\\r\\nlike that of a wounded animal! But she rallied rapidly and said with\\r\\neagerness: \"Oh, you are mistaken! It is some other person whose name\\r\\nyou have mistaken for his. He would not—why, Rufus could not do such a\\r\\nthing!\"\"My dear child, I am not mistaken.\" The very quietness of the woman\\'s\\r\\nvoice and manner carried conviction. \"The name is R. H. Keller and the\\r\\nman who is with you here to-night is the one who sat before me with you\\r\\nyesterday afternoon, and wrote his name as I have told you, just before\\r\\nI did on the register.\"Suddenly the poor girl broke into bitter weeping. \"What shall I do!\"\\r\\nshe wailed. \"Oh, what shall I do! Oh, mother! If I had never gone away\\r\\nfrom you! I have killed her! I have killed my mother!\"\"No, you haven\\'t!\" Mrs. Dunlap\\'s voice had never been quieter, nor\\r\\nfirmer. \"You are going home to her this morning, as soon as the train\\r\\ngoes. In a few hours she will have her arms about you. And when you are\\r\\nreally being married, she will stand very near you, and be the first\\r\\nto kiss you, and call you her darling.

       " 'anything! Come with me to my room and wait until train time. There\\r\\nought to be one very early in the morning, and I will see you safely to\\r\\nit.\"The girl seized the little hand bag she had dropped, and spoke\\r\\nhurriedly.\"Where is the room? Oh, quick! Take me to it, will you? That was what\\r\\nI wanted; a place to be alone and think. I don\\'t know what I can do,\\r\\nbut I must decide; and I must do it before Mr. Keller comes back,\\r\\nbecause—oh, will you let me go into your room and lock the door?\"They both turned hurriedly at the sound of footsteps.It was a porter to say that No. 37 was ready; and never were fleeter\\r\\nsteps than those that followed his lead.\"Oh, hurry!\" the girl said breathlessly as they reached the room, and\\r\\nit was she who turned the key in the lock after the retreating porter.\\r\\nThen she dropped a limp heap into the nearest chair and cried.Mrs. Dunlap left her quite to herself and thanked God for the tears.\"What shall I do if he comes and demands to be let in?\" the girl asked\\r\\nsuddenly, looking up at her deliverer. \"He is so—so masterful; and he\\r\\ndoes not look at things as I do. He thinks that a few hours cannot make\\r\\nany difference. I know how he argued it out with himself that he could\\r\\nnot leave me alone, and that he would shield my name by giving me his\\r\\nin advance, but I cannot do it, I cannot!

This is my room; he will hardly\\r\\ncome to it without my permission. If you think it is necessary to\\r\\nexplain your absence, I will go down to him, if you will let me, and\\r\\nexplain what is necessary.\"\"Oh, if you will! I mean if you can! He is very determined; and he is\\r\\nused to having his own way; I cannot think that he will let me—\"She was trembling so violently that she could scarcely speak.Mrs. Dunlap passed an arm about her and spoke as she might have done to\\r\\na frightened child.\"Don\\'t think about that part of it any more; I am not in the least\\r\\nafraid of him; and I will take care of you! Have you a kimono in this\\r\\nbag? Let me help you take off your dress, just as your mother would,\\r\\nand slip the kimono on for a little while. I have been looking at the\\r\\ntime table. You can have almost three hours of quiet; then I will take\\r\\nyou to the train. We can plan all the details afterwards.\"\"Oh, you are so kind!\" murmured the girl.\"I am going downstairs now,\" the woman said when the girl had submitted\\r\\nto her ministrations, resisting the suggestion about the bed, but\\r\\nallowing herself to be propped among pillows in an easy chair. \"I will',\n",
       " 'to her ministrations, resisting the suggestion about the bed, but\\r\\nallowing herself to be propped among pillows in an easy chair. \"I will\\r\\ncome back in a little while; or would you rather have this room quite\\r\\nto yourself? I can be comfortable down on one of the couches, and I\\r\\nwill come for you in ample time for the train.\"\"No! Oh, no!\" the girl said, the look of fear coming into her eyes\\r\\nagain. \"Please don\\'t leave me! And yet you must! Would you mind locking\\r\\nthe door and taking the key with you? I cannot help a feeling that—\"\"She is afraid of him!\" was Mrs. Dunlap\\'s mental comment as she sped\\r\\ndown the hall with the key in her pocket.On the whole she decided she was rather glad of an opportunity to tell\\r\\nthat man what she thought of him.She had little time to collect her thoughts, for the subject of them\\r\\nhurried in soon after she entered the parlor.There was an ugly frown on his face. Evidently the interview from which\\r\\nhe had just come had irritated him.He strode to the corner where he had left his companion and stared\\r\\nabout him perplexedly; then turned an angry questioning look upon Mrs.\\r\\nDunlap.\"Are you looking for the lady who was here when you left the room?\" She\\r\\nasked pleasantly, determined to be courteous if possible. \"She has gone\\r\\nto my room to get some rest, and asked me to say to you that she is all\\r\\nright and quite comfortable for the night.\"He strode toward her with a glare in his eyes that would have',\n",
       " 'right and quite comfortable for the night.\"He strode toward her with a glare in his eyes that would have\\r\\nfrightened a less courageous spirit, and spoke in an angry voice: \"Who\\r\\nare you that you presume to interfere in the lady\\'s affairs?\" he said\\r\\nhaughtily. \"I have a room for her to rest in, and you will oblige me\\r\\nby telling her that I am waiting for her, and then by minding your own\\r\\nbusiness.\"Mrs. Dunlap had the advantage of this angry man; she was perfectly cool\\r\\nand calm.\"You are mistaken,\" she said. \"I have the right to interfere, because\\r\\nthe lady has claimed my protection and I am abundantly able and willing\\r\\nto give it.\"\"Protection from what!\" he thundered.\"From Mr. Keller, I fancy. I supposed, of course, that the lady in\\r\\nquestion was your wife, as I had seen you together during the day, and\\r\\nnoticed how you registered. Since she has informed me that she is not;\\r\\nand, furthermore, that she does not wish to see you again to-night, I\\r\\nhave aided her in carrying out her wishes and must insist on her not\\r\\nbeing disturbed.\"\"Must you indeed! How do you expect to accomplish the task of keeping\\r\\nme away from the lady who is under my protection, and for whom I alone\\r\\nam responsible?\"There was menace in his tone and in the glare of his eyes. Mrs. Dunlap\\r\\nlifted her eyebrows with a gesture of contempt, but she spoke quietly.\"This is absurd, Mr. Keller. I have no wish to make matters more\\r\\nuncomfortable than is necessary; but of course you are aware that this',\n",
       " 'uncomfortable than is necessary; but of course you are aware that this\\r\\nis a respectable house. You are here in company with a young woman whom\\r\\nyou registered as your wife; and you ordered a room for yourself and\\r\\nher; but she says that she is not your wife, and that she does not wish\\r\\nto see you again to-night. I do not need to remind you how promptly\\r\\nthe proprietor of this house, as well as its guests, would come to\\r\\nher aid if necessary; nor that policemen and lockups are conveniences\\r\\nwithin call. If you compel me to resort to such measures, you will have\\r\\nyourself to thank.\"There was something about Mary Dunlap when she chose to assert herself\\r\\nthat commanded respect. Keller looked into the clear stern eyes of\\r\\nthis woman and realized that he must not go too far. He glared at her,\\r\\nbaffled for an instant, and when she still continued to look steadily\\r\\nat him, he wheeled and took a few steps away from her. Then, after a\\r\\nmoment, with a sound that was evidently an attempt at a laugh but was\\r\\nmore like a sneer, he turned and came toward her again, trying to speak\\r\\nlightly:\"You women are too much for me! I may as well take you into my\\r\\nconfidence, as the lady has evidently seen fit to do. It is true that\\r\\nthe formal ceremony which was to have made us man and wife in the eyes\\r\\nof a curious world has not yet taken place, but the mere formality\\r\\nis all that is lacking.

If it were not for a wrecked engine and this\\r\\ninfernal delay, Mrs. Grundy, whom you are personifying, would have\\r\\nbeen able to sleep peacefully. I registered as I had expected to do\\r\\nafter I had reached the station where the clergyman was waiting for\\r\\nus, because I did not wish to leave the lady alone, in her wearied,\\r\\nand nervous state, but desired to minister to her comfort, as I would\\r\\nassuredly have been able to do, had we not been interfered with in this\\r\\nextraordinary manner. I did not consider it necessary to explain to the\\r\\nlady that I had anticipated the ceremony by a few hours, in writing her\\r\\nname as mine, and thus securing a quiet room for her to rest in.\"I may further say that business complications in which a good deal of\\r\\nmoney was involved, have made it necessary for me to move with caution\\r\\nin this entire matter, and for this reason I brought her away with me\\r\\nquietly, before the outward forms had been complied with; but she came\\r\\nwithout coercion of any sort as she will be ready to inform you, if\\r\\nyou explain that you suspect me of being at least an accomplice in a\\r\\ncase of kidnapping!

If it will comfort you to know it, I assure you that three\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation with my lady, will be sufficient to allay any\\r\\nfears that you may have succeeded in working up.\"This biting sarcasm, partially veiled at times by mock courtesy, was\\r\\nconcluded with what was intended to be a bow of dismissal.But Mrs. Dunlap was never more quietly determined in her course of\\r\\naction. Every word that the man had spoken increased her distrust of\\r\\nhim.\"We need not argue,\" she said. \"You have told me nothing that I did\\r\\nnot know before.

Fierce indignation,\\r\\ndoubt, perplexity, intense disgust, each struggled for the ascendancy.\\r\\nBut Mrs. Dunlap was about to leave the room. The necessity for\\r\\npropitiating her in some way forced itself upon him.\"Wait!\" he said imperatively. \"You do not understand. Is it possible to\\r\\nmake you understand the conditions? Sit down and let me explain just\\r\\nwhat has happened, and what I am trying to do.\"His manner became suddenly courteous, and he began to talk volubly,\\r\\nexplaining, in more minute detail than the occasion seemed to call for,\\r\\nthe devious ways by which he had reached this point; enlarging upon\\r\\nhis deep affection for the lady of his choice, and his desire to free\\r\\nher from the narrow and cramped life in which he found her. Her mother\\r\\nwas a commonplace, narrow-minded, exceedingly prejudiced person who\\r\\nentirely dominated her daughter\\'s life; so that she was in danger of\\r\\nhaving no individuality, he said.Among other proofs of the mother\\'s folly, she had conceived a violent\\r\\ndislike to himself; and carried her tyranny to such an extent that the\\r\\ngirl was not even allowed to receive a call from him, unless the mother',\n",
       " \"dislike to himself; and carried her tyranny to such an extent that the\\r\\ngirl was not even allowed to receive a call from him, unless the mother\\r\\nwas present! Matters were in this state, and he was at an utter loss\\r\\nhow to further the daughter's interests, when his good angel, came to\\r\\nhis rescue. The girl went to spend a month with a very intimate friend,\\r\\nwho had married and removed to a town a hundred miles from her home.\\r\\nThen, quite unexpectedly to himself, business connected with his firm\\r\\nsent him to that very town. All the rest had followed, almost, he might\\r\\nsay, because of the necessities of the case. He had discovered that\\r\\nthe young lady's affections were as deeply involved as his own, and\\r\\nthat she despaired, as deeply as he did himself, of ever winning her\\r\\nnarrow-minded mother to take their view of things.Mrs. Dunlap was called upon to assent to the statement that common\\r\\npeople were apt to have violent prejudices for which they could not\\r\\naccount, and were the hardest persons on earth to move. Still, he would\\r\\nadmit that in carrying out the program that followed he had acted upon\\r\\nsudden impulse rather than premeditated plans.When the time came for the lady to return home, Providence seemed to\\r\\nmake a way for them to be happy. He need not explain that he had used\\r\\nno coercion in the matter; the lady realized only too certainly that\\r\\nher mother stood in the way of her happiness, and that if she had her\",\n",

So, in a moment, one might say, it was all arranged;\\r\\nindeed it almost arranged itself. He had a friend in the ministry at a\\r\\ntown which was an important junction of the railroad, and to him, he\\r\\nsent a message planning all the necessary details; but for the horrible\\r\\ndelay because of that disabled engine, everything would have been\\r\\ncomplete.But the delay and confusion and the necessity for their stopping\\r\\novernight at a strange hotel had bewildered and frightened the girl,\\r\\nunused as she was to being alone, or to thinking and planning for\\r\\nherself. It was the knowledge of that, which had led him to make the\\r\\nmistake of registering as he did; he could now see that it was a\\r\\nmistake. He knew there was but one room to be had, and his only thought\\r\\nhad been to secure privacy for her and the right to minister to her\\r\\ncomfort. At the moment there seemed no other way; but he would admit\\r\\nthat it had a bad look to others, who did not understand the situation.\\r\\nFor himself these outward conventions never seemed of paramount\\r\\nimportance so long as one understood one's self.

He was even\\r\\ngrateful for her interference, when he came to think carefully,\\r\\nalthough he would confess that at first it seemed unpardonable.

Even in the\\r\\nhalls she came upon treasures of art to study over, and as she lingered\\r\\nbefore them, she told herself with a half wistful smile that she must\\r\\nhave a care lest she become envious of Mrs. Oliver.Then she fell to moralizing. Was it probable that her hostess had her\\r\\nheart\\'s desire in all things? It looked so.There were two daughters, she had heard, who were their mother\\'s joy\\r\\nand pride also. Certainly the outward appearance of the home left\\r\\nnothing to wish for. In such an atmosphere it was hardly possible\\r\\nto avoid thinking of sharply contrasted lives.

       " 'pleasantly, and he stepped forward and grasped Mrs. Dunlap\\'s hand,\\r\\ngiving her a swift searching glance.\"I certainly am!\" said Mary Dunlap with a hearty handclasp.He lingered only a minute or two to leave a message for the daughter\\r\\nabout what had happened at the committee meeting, but he gave another\\r\\nkeen parting glance accompanied by a warming smile as he left, that\\r\\nmade the stranger feel that he approved of her, and that he understood\\r\\nthat she was in no wise the cause of the tears that he had seen on\\r\\nDaisy\\'s mother\\'s face.After he was gone, Mrs. Sheldon came back to her caller.\"Why couldn\\'t it have been that young man?\" asked Mary Dunlap with a\\r\\nsigh!\"Oh, if it only could have been!\" sighed the mother. \"He is the dearest\\r\\nboy! My husband trusted him so. He has been Daisy\\'s schoolmate and\\r\\ncompanion for years, and yet she could think she has fallen in love\\r\\nwith that other creature!\"\"There, there, dear friend. I tell you the human heart is a mystery.\\r\\nAnd a girl at Daisy\\'s age gets queer ideas sometimes. She will come out\\r\\nof it and be fine and beautiful. You see!\"\"Oh! I don\\'t know!\" sighed the mother. \"She is so strange! Not even\\r\\nwilling to see Nelson. She thought it was Nelson when you came, and\\r\\nrushed away telling me she would not see him nor anyone else to-night!\\r\\nI could not tell him that of course. He has been so kind and so\\r\\ndevoted. And I can see that he is terribly worried about this Keller.',\n",

And I can see that he is terribly worried about this Keller.\\r\\nHe looks as if he would like to fight every time Daisy mentions his\\r\\nname. But tell me, what did the fellow do when you told him Daisy was\\r\\ngoing to remain with you for the night?\"\"Do? He was fairly insolent. He was furious. He told me to mind my\\r\\nown business. He strode around that parlor like a madman, till I told\\r\\nhim Daisy had appealed to me for protection, and had told me she was\\r\\nnot yet married to him; but that I had seen how he registered in the\\r\\nhotel. Then he calmed down a little and began to try to smooth things\\r\\nover. He tried to explain that he had done that merely to protect the\\r\\ngirl, and that he intended to make everything right for her. He even\\r\\ncame to the point, before we were done, of saying that perhaps he had\\r\\nbeen wrong in doing it, but he had followed an impulse when he wrote.\\r\\nOh, you know how a man like that could lie himself out of anything! He\\r\\neven said that of course if Daisy preferred to be with me, it was all\\r\\nright, but he really must see her before she slept and arrange about\\r\\nhis telegrams. Of course I saw through that. He knew his influence over\\r\\nher!\"So I told him she had asked not to be disturbed, and that she did not\\r\\nwish to see him again until she was at home with her mother and her\\r\\nmother knew all.

I had looked\\r\\nup trains and found there was a very early one. Perhaps he was asleep,\\r\\nalthough I was taking no chances. I decided to stay by till I placed\\r\\nher safely in her mother\\'s care.\"\"You have been wonderful!\" said the mother. \"I can never thank you.\\r\\nAnd I\\'m glad too, that you came and told me all to-night. It has been\\r\\nvery hard to hear, but it was right that I should know. Only, my dear\\r\\nnew strong friend, I don\\'t know what I am going to do. I am terrified\\r\\nat what may yet develop. I am sure that man will not be easily shaken\\r\\noff. He is probably only waiting till Daisy gets all strained up with\\r\\nanxiety, as she is now, when he knows she will be wax in his hands. I\\r\\ncannot believe he will give up so easily. He will know that you cannot\\r\\nlinger around to protect always, and unfortunately, he is not afraid of\\r\\nme.\"\"My dear, wait until you have heard the rest of the story.\"\"Oh, is there more?\" The mother\\'s face showed a new terror.She sat up tense and anxious clasping her frail hands in one another',\n",

She had often invited me to\\r\\nbe her guest and talk over various matters with her, but I had never\\r\\nbeen able to arrange a definite date before. I arrived at midnight, and\\r\\nwas taken almost at once to my room, seeing none of the family that\\r\\nnight except my hostess.\"But the next morning at breakfast I was introduced to her two lovely\\r\\ndaughters, and a moment later to her husband who had arrived a few\\r\\nmoments before on an early train from the West. Perhaps you can imagine\\r\\nmy horror when I looked up to greet him, and found that the man to whom\\r\\nMrs. Oliver was introducing me, calling him \\'her husband Mr. Oliver,\\'\\r\\nwas the Mr. Keller from whom your daughter had been rescued a few\\r\\nnights before!\"Mary Dunlap had told the end of her story rapidly, conscious that her\\r\\nlistener was under a heavy strain, and now she looked up with relief\\r\\nthat all was told.But the poor mother had borne all she could.

Have you come here to\\r\\nmake more trouble for us? Who are you, anyway?\"THE girl stood in the doorway, her eyes flashing like blue flames, her\\r\\ndelicate profile outlined against the rich portier, chin lifted, in\\r\\nscorn, the light catching the glint of the waves in her pretty hair and\\r\\nturning them into gold, the delicate blue of her silk kimono bringing\\r\\nout the pearly tint of her skin, a haughty little patrician, insolent\\r\\nin her loveliness.Mary Dunlap looked at her in pity, and admiration, and a rising wonder.\\r\\nWas this the girl who had melted to tears in her arms but a few nights\\r\\nbefore, and implored her to protect her?

Not so the girl of that night. She\\r\\ndid not even wince. Instead she drew herself up to her full height\\r\\nand looked her mother steadily in the eyes, as if their ages had been\\r\\nreversed, and spoke with a certain air of authority that was almost\\r\\nstartling.\"No, I am not beside myself, Mother!

Mrs. Sheldon,\\r\\nmortified to the extreme of agony over the way her daughter was raving\\r\\nout against the wonderful woman who had saved her from a life of\\r\\nhumiliation; alarmed beyond measure for the sanity of the one who was\\r\\ndearer to her than life, roused from her own weakness and tried every\\r\\npossible means to bring the girl to reason, all to no purpose.At last Mary Dunlap who had stood by helpless, trying to think of\\r\\nsomething she might say which would bring the girl to her senses,\\r\\nleaned over toward the mother and said in a low tone:\"Suppose I just go away for the night now. She is excited and the sight\\r\\nof me only irritates her. If she could get some sleep she might be more\\r\\nreasonable in the morning. No, don\\'t get up. I can find my own way to\\r\\nthe door.

The mother slipped to her knees\\r\\nand began to pray.A voice of power spoke to her soul, while she was still on her knees,\\r\\nseeking help.

I would not like to tear your heart\\r\\nnor soil my lips by repeating the words that he used to describe your\\r\\nwonderful mother and her ignorant prejudice as he called it.\"He also told me that his friend who posed as a minister for the time\\r\\nbeing was an amateur play actor who had successfully impersonated a\\r\\nclergyman while they were in college, which gave him the idea of a mock\\r\\nmarriage to quiet your protests.\"And now, I will show you a paper written and signed by this man, in\\r\\nwhich he pledges never to write or telegraph or telephone you, or\\r\\nvisit you again.

With closed eyes\\r\\nshe prayed, her soul crying out from the depth of her failure. She had\\r\\ndone her best for this little sister and she had utterly failed. Now\\r\\nshe called upon her Father for sustaining strength, for light, for\\r\\nguidance, for calmness in the midst of despair; for the headstrong\\r\\nblinded girl, and for the worn despairing mother.Then out of her despair came peace, and suddenly a knowledge that the\\r\\nFather cared more than she did, even more than the stricken mother.She became aware of the entrance of that mother, quietly, like a little\\r\\nsad wraith.Lifting her head she tried to smile but failed.\"It was no use!\" she said sadly, \"She would not believe a word that I\\r\\nsaid.\"\"Oh, my dear strong friend!\" breathed the little mother, \"What should\\r\\nI do without you?

Come, let us trust Him, and tell him so.\"Right there by the stairs Mary Dunlap prayed, talking to the Lord as\\r\\nif He stood where she could see Him, asking directions for what they\\r\\nshould do next.When the brief prayer was over the mother lifted her head and stood up.\"Daisy is not used to traveling alone! Especially out in the night this\\r\\nway, and to a great city!\" She spoke in a tone of deep anguish.\"She is not alone!\" said Mary Dunlap solemnly, \"God is with her!\"Then after an instant she added:\"And there is no reason why we should not follow, is there?

No, I don\\'t suppose there was,\" said the\\r\\nperplexed mother reversing the order of the questions, \"but somehow it\\r\\nseems all wrong not to have him along when we are in trouble.\"\"Well,\" said Mary Dunlap thoughtfully, \"if the Lord needs him, He\\'ll\\r\\nknow how to send him. Don\\'t you fret.\"Fortunately both women were dead with sleep, and were able to get\\r\\nsome real refreshing rest in their chairs while the miles raced along\\r\\nbeneath the wheels, and Daisy drew nearer to New York.What would Daisy do when she got to New York? Her mother could not keep\\r\\nthe question out of her mind, and yet she could not answer it. Oh, what\\r\\nawful experience might she not have if she went to that office and met\\r\\nher old lover!

Who knew what the\\r\\nday had in store for them?NELSON WHITNEY rang the bell of the Sheldon House at exactly quarter\\r\\npast eight the next morning.

Who was that other woman? Was she connected with this\\r\\nsudden exodus? He had liked her. She seemed a strong true friend. He\\r\\nremembered the twinkle in her eyes, though they had looked grave, even\\r\\nsorrowful as if she was full of sympathy.He sighed again as he remembered how strange it was to have the family\\r\\ngo off this way without telling him.

When they were\\r\\ngoing away, it was always he who got their reservations, checked their\\r\\nbaggage, and took them to the station in his car, that is, since he had\\r\\nbeen old enough to have a car. Before that he attended them in a hired\\r\\ntaxi.But now, the last few months, there had been growing a change. Mrs.\\r\\nSheldon was just the same, but Marguerite had a certain reserve, as if\\r\\nhe didn\\'t matter any more. It was all since that night when the Farr\\r\\ngirl brought that Keller fellow with her to their literary club, and\\r\\nintroduced him to Marguerite. Whitney had heard him calling her \"Daisy\"\\r\\nthe very first night; \"Daisy,\" the name that belonged exclusively to\\r\\nher mother—and himself—up to that night!After that, he studiously called her Marguerite. He wanted no name for\\r\\nhis girl that he had to share with that man!

Yes, it was Marguerite\\'s writing. Probably\\r\\nsome directions about color and fabrics. Maybe a bit of a word of\\r\\napology for going so hurriedly, or even a friendly goodbye. His heart\\r\\nwas lifted at the thought. His eyes plunged into the midst of the words\\r\\nin the dim light of the hall, and grasped, searching for that personal\\r\\nword which he so longed to read.

Could any calamity loom greater than that to Nelson Whitney\\r\\nin the whole bright world that had suddenly gone black?At that instant, while he was turning over those awful facts and trying\\r\\nto make something out of them, he heard Mary\\'s brisk footsteps coming\\r\\ndown the stairs.

Was this a wild-goose chase he was going on?\\r\\nWouldn\\'t anybody, just anybody think he was a fool to start off with as\\r\\nlittle warrant as he had had? Wasn\\'t there danger of making his lady\\r\\neverlastingly angry chasing her this way, even if he did find her?\\r\\nWouldn\\'t even her mother have a right to resent it?And what, pray, was he to do when he arrived in New York, beyond the\\r\\nmere meeting the trains at the station, and getting in touch with\\r\\nthe people he was trying to help? How could he do that? Just walk up',\n",

Just walk up\\r\\nsmiling and say he knew they were expected so he met them? He hadn't\\r\\nreally any warrant for that. Of course he could say that Mary told him\\r\\nwhat train they had taken, but he would feel like a fool saying that to\\r\\nMrs. Sheldon. Her keen eyes would see that there was something behind\\r\\nit all, and perhaps she might resent his intrusion into her affairs,\\r\\nthough she had always acted, hitherto, as if he belonged to her scheme\\r\\nof life.And what could he do before her train arrived to keep Marguerite in\\r\\nsight? If he met her train, she would be likely to be indignant. He\\r\\ncould not tell her he had found her note on the floor, and read it,\\r\\nthough it was addressed to her mother, and that he was here to protect\\r\\nher from whatever evil, real or fancied, threatened her. Assuredly he\\r\\nwould meet her train and try to appear as casual as possible, but he\\r\\nshrank inexpressibly from the look of scorn her dear eyes would cast at\\r\\nhim.There was no question but that Marguerite would resent his entrance\\r\\nonto the stage at this point in her career. She had been most haughty\\r\\nand independent of late, and it stung him even to remember her careless\\r\\nindifference.And failing to get suitable touch with his girl at the train, if he\\r\\nshould go to hunt up that number of Fifth Avenue, and should find it\",\n",

Of course he\\r\\ncould telephone back when he got to New York, but a lot of time might\\r\\nbe lost.However, was he not traveling under guidance? Could not He who had\\r\\nsmoothed the way thus far manage it so that he would go to the right\\r\\nplace, do the right thing? Would not the way open as he advanced?\\r\\nHe had put himself under the guidance of the greatest Leader in the\\r\\nuniverse, and there he must trust and not be afraid.The silver wings that bore him above the earth flew straight on, over\\r\\nwide stretches of the map. Sometimes he looked down wondering, when he\\r\\nsaw a railroad train creeping along like a small worm on the earth, if\\r\\nperhaps he might be looking at the very train in which those he went to\\r\\nprotect were traveling.The strange thing about it all was that though he was positive they\\r\\nneeded protection, he was not in the least sure from what he was\\r\\nprotecting them.

And the way had been smoothed before him. Nothing had been\\r\\nhindered of the least detail to stop him from going through the air.So the silver wings flew on, and in due time Nelson Whitney arrived in\\r\\nNew York.He did not help his friend in painting the town red. Instead he went\\r\\ndirectly to the Pennsylvania station and got full details of all trains\\r\\narriving from the West. He found that Marguerite's train was due to\\r\\narrive late that evening. He begged off from going with his friend\\r\\nlonger than to dinner, and went straight back to the station where he\\r\\nmade himself well acquainted with the various exits of the train, and\\r\\nfound the best place to watch and await her.It had not been hard to discover just where the train would come\\r\\nin, and he had established himself behind the great iron bars just\\r\\nabove the train floor, where he could look down upon the disembarking\\r\\npassengers without being seen by them unless they deliberately turned\\r\\naround and looked up, but near enough to the train gate to get to her\",\n",

He would tell how he had called at the house for\\r\\nher list, and Mary had said she had gone to New York on the midnight\\r\\ntrain. So when he was invited to fly with his friend to the same city,\\r\\nhe thought he would meet her train and ask her about the list, in case\\r\\nhe went back the next day. That was a perfectly reasonable story as\\r\\nwell as being absolutely true, for his friend had many times invited\\r\\nhim to fly, and had told him to call him when he could go.Nevertheless he wished to reconnoiter before he approached her. It\\r\\nwas even conceivable that that Keller person might have somehow got\\r\\nin touch with her, and be traveling with her. His blood boiled at the\\r\\nthought, and he stood for twenty long minutes till the train arrived,\\r\\nthinking over what he should do if that were the case. He decided that\\r\\nhe would in any event go to the gate and speak to Marguerite. It might\\r\\neven be that a face from home might influence her, hinder her, from any\\r\\nfoolish thing she might be going to do.

The stream of people like\\r\\nants, came filing up the iron stairs to the gateways, and not one of\\r\\nthem escaped the anxious eye of Nelson Whitney, as he stood in his\\r\\nsheltered nook behind a bunch of train flags and gate signs and waited.But Marguerite did not appear.She did not even come up in the elevator, which was in full view from\\r\\nhis position. He was sure he had not missed her, yet a frenzy of\\r\\nanxiety seized him. Perhaps she had seen him and had evaded him while\\r\\nhe was looking the other way!Where was Marguerite?WHAT had happened to Marguerite was this.She had never been to New York before, although she had traveled with\\r\\nher father and mother now and then in other directions. She knew\\r\\nnothing, of course, about the city save what she had gleaned from\\r\\noccasional references to it in novels.

I\\'m going downtown.\"\"Then you get out at Manhattan Transfer, lady,\" said the porter eyeing\\r\\nher a bit questioningly, she thought, because she had said downtown at\\r\\nthat time of night.Manhattan Transfer looked wide and desolate and empty. There were\\r\\nfew passengers so late and there seemed to be no official in charge.\\r\\nMarguerite stood aimlessly for a few minutes, looking this way and\\r\\nthat, wandering up, and then down, looking off at the dim distance of\\r\\nstars and weird lights. Was this the great New York about which she had\\r\\nheard so much?But at last a train came. A brakeman on the step, swinging a lantern,\\r\\nand yelling some unintelligible thing condescended to listen to her\\r\\nplea.\"Where you wantta go, lady? Uptown or downtown?\" The same mystical\\r\\nquestion, and it must have been all wrong the way she answered it\\r\\nbefore.\"Oh, I don\\'t know which,\" she cried, almost in tears, for she was\\r\\nsuddenly realizing her lonely situation at this late hour. \"I want to\\r\\ngo to a good respectable hotel.\"\"You go uptown lady, then.

Thus it was\\r\\nthat she arrived at the great station almost an hour later than the\\r\\ntrain by which she should have come. Emerging into the gloom, and\\r\\nclimbing the midnight stairs into the wide upper area, she felt smaller\\r\\nand more alone even than when she had stood on the high barren sweep of\\r\\nManhattan Transfer.There was noise and light here, a blare of it, and a strange midnight\\r\\nclatter that frightened her.If it had not been for a kindly agent of the Traveller\\'s Aid who\\r\\nhappened by just as she emerged from the iron gate, and said, noting\\r\\nher hesitancy, \"Can I help you?\" she might have stood there all night\\r\\nperhaps, afraid to venture into that vast empty floor like a little\\r\\nvessel setting sail to an unknown port.But the friendly Traveller\\'s Aid soon had the weary girl safely\\r\\nestablished in the great hotel across the way, and possessed of all the\\r\\ninformation she needed to get herself to the desired number on Fifth\\r\\nAvenue in the morning.Mind and body cannot continue forever in a state of violent emotion',\n",

She thought she had a pretty good idea where to telegraph him,\\r\\nand felt that if she did so, it would only be a matter of a few hours\\r\\nbefore she had word that he was coming to her at once.She was not well enough versed in the ways of travelers to leave an\\r\\norder at the hotel desk to have them call her at seven, and if she had\\r\\nbeen, she would have been too confident that it was unnecessary.

Presently a nervous step came\\r\\ndown the corridor, almost breathlessly, as if the owner had hurried,\\r\\nthen hesitated a moment in front of the door.

His hand was shaking, as he wrote his\\r\\nname, Ralph H. Oliver across the back of the check. It was an old\\r\\nblank one which Mrs. Dunlap had carried with her in her purse for\\r\\nseveral months in case of emergency. That morning she had made it out\\r\\nto herself, signed with her maiden name and endorsed it. But the man\\r\\nwho endorsed it again was not even noticing whether it was a check\\r\\nor not.

Anything no matter how ghastly,\\r\\nwas better than what would probably happen if he remained.He swung himself around to face Mrs. Dunlap, and put Marguerite out of\\r\\nrange, as he handed over the check with a hand that was shaking visibly.Again the stiffening lips wrinkled themselves into a ghastly semblance\\r\\nof a smile as he spoke, his manner an attempt at the debonair:\"Mrs. Dunlap, I think my wife is in my private office, and she will',\n",

I told them where we were going, wrote it\\r\\ndown for them so they wouldn\\'t make a mistake.\"With relief, the weary mother relaxed the drawn look of her face and\\r\\nturned to the Olivers graciously.\"I\\'m so glad to have met you,\" she said, and smiled sincerely.When they were gone Gloria turned to her mother.\"I didn\\'t like the way she spoke to you, Mums dear!\" she said. \"It was\\r\\nalmost as if she felt sorry for you somehow.\"\"What a queer idea!\" laughed her mother. \"I think she is a very\\r\\ncharming woman. In fact anybody Mrs. Dunlap sponsors usually is.\"\"Yourself included, Mums!\" laughed Gloria. \"Come on Muth, lets rout out\\r\\nDad and get started. We\\'re two hours behind schedule now. Kath, you\\r\\nought to have run things better than this!\" And laughing they went off\\r\\nto find the beloved husband and father.They found him standing by the window with the sash thrown up, wiping\\r\\nbeads of perspiration from his forehead, though the day was keen and\\r\\nclear.\"What\\'s the matter, dear? Is there any trouble about your business?\"\\r\\nasked Mrs. Oliver solicitously.\"I wasn\\'t feeling very well there for a minute!\" said the valiant\\r\\nhusband, mopping his cold brow once more. \"I felt a little dizzy!',\n",

He still wore a sort of whipped\\r\\nlook except to his family\\'s eyes.But at that they all shouted a joyous assent, \"Yes, Dad, that would be\\r\\ngreat! Then you\\'d be all ours and not belong to the world at large any\\r\\nmore,\" added Gloria as the hurrah subsided.\"Come on, let\\'s go!\" said Oliver turning away from them quickly to hide\\r\\na look of something like shame that stole over his scared white face.\"But we haven\\'t given Muth her presents yet,\" reminded Gloria who never\\r\\nby any chance forgot anything.It was with relief that Oliver took the little white box containing the\\r\\nwatch from his pocket. The attention all focused upon it, instead of\\r\\nhimself, he was able even to make a pleasant little flowery speech in\\r\\npresentation.Nevertheless the occasion had ceased to be the joyous celebration that\\r\\nhe had anticipated.

The fearful responsibilities of life that a day ago had\\r\\nlain upon her heart with deathlike heaviness, were gone. Life had been\\r\\nsettled for her, and her path diverted from a dark and perilous way,\\r\\ninto brightness and sunshine again.The only thing that hung about and troubled her was her own shame.

How could\\r\\nhe dare bring her a love so dishonored by his own broken, worse than\\r\\nbroken vows? For she was not one of those girls who feel it a fine\\r\\nfeather to have won for herself a man who belongs to another.She shivered as she remembered the way he had said: \"My wife,\" and, \"my\\r\\ndaughters,\" in that accustomed married way.

What I meant is, are you too tired to take on sight\\r\\nseeing or are you really interested? It occurred to me that we weren\\'t\\r\\neither of us in a state to get much intellectual good out of either a\\r\\ntomb or a museum, but perhaps I\\'m mistaken. If you want to, we\\'ll go.\\r\\nBut if you are not particular which day we go tombing, suppose we take\\r\\na lighter expedition. I\\'ll tell you what would just suit me. I\\'d like\\r\\nto take you down to Tiffany\\'s and buy you the prettiest diamond ring we\\r\\ncan find.\"Marguerite started back in her chair.\"Oh, Nelson! What do you mean?\"Her face was a curious study of tenderness and fear.\"I mean just that, Daisy. I think it\\'s high time you had some kind of a\\r\\nsafeguard to wear. I\\'ve loved you too long and known you too well, to\\r\\nlet you drift around the world unprotected any longer.\"\"But—Nelson—\"\"Yes, I know—you want to tell me that you don\\'t love me—that you\\r\\ncouldn\\'t possibly love one man when you\\'ve just got over caring for\\r\\nanother, and all that—but I\\'m going to do this anyway.

But you do have to wear my ring for a while\\r\\nanyway. You\\'re not going back home without it, I\\'ll tell the world.\\r\\nNobody is going to have a chance, not that dirty crook of a Keller\\r\\nanyway, to say that he threw you over. You\\'re going home engaged to me,\\r\\nMarguerite Sheldon, whatever you do with me afterward, you may as well\\r\\nunderstand that I have the upper hand now, and you\\'re going to have a\\r\\nring, right now!\"You can take it for all the love I have in the world, if you\\'re\\r\\nwilling, or you can take it for just a means of protection for the time\\r\\nbeing if that suits you any better, but somehow I\\'m going to put my tag\\r\\non my property. Until you\\'ve told me that you out and out can\\'t love me\\r\\never, I\\'m out to see that you\\'re known as belonging to me.\"There was such quiet strength and tenderness in the way he said these\\r\\nwords, so low that they could not possibly reach other ears than her\\r\\nown, so full of real feeling and earnestness, that she could not turn\\r\\naway from, nor laugh it off.

He attended them up to the door of their room, kissed\\r\\nMarguerite reverently, and then half shyly kissed her mother and said:\\r\\n\"Good night, Mother!\" with an accent in his tone that spoke volumes.He left both mother and daughter tingling with joy and pride in him,\\r\\nand then at last the door was closed on the outer world, shutting them\\r\\nin alone together.The girl hurried into the closet to hang up her coat and hat, feeling a',\n",

She was thinking of what her new friend\\r\\nhad said to her that afternoon, and of the Bible verse she had quoted\\r\\nto her. And how wonderfully, and swiftly the promise had been made good\\r\\nto her. Why, she had scarcely waked from that refreshing sleep into\\r\\nwhich she had fallen pillowed on that promise, when the fulfillment had\\r\\nknocked at her door in the person of Nelson and Marguerite come to show\\r\\nher the ring.Marguerite had been shy and lovely, but almost silent and they had not\\r\\npressed her to talk much. She had been most humble and loving toward\\r\\nher mother and Mrs. Dunlap, thanking that great-hearted woman in no\\r\\nuncertain words, although they were few, and clasping her in a close\\r\\npenitent embrace when she left.But to her mother Marguerite had as yet said not one word about the\\r\\nhappenings of the last few days. She had let her lover do all the\\r\\ntalking, and had sat with downcast lashes, and a childlike contentment\\r\\nin her face that yet spoke volumes of reassurance to the two who had\\r\\nwaited through the long hours to know how it fared with her.But now the time had come, and Marguerite knew it, to have it out with',\n",

But\\r\\nat last she came out.Mrs. Sheldon was taking down her hair for the night, and it fell in\\r\\nlovely silver waves to her waist, with soft little tendrils, and a curl\\r\\nor two at the ends. It seemed to glorify her delicate face and set her\\r\\noff as if it had been a halo.The girl watched her lovely mother for a moment, wistfully, wishing she\\r\\nwould begin, and then suddenly she burst forth with tears:\"I don\\'t see how I could have done it to you!\" she said in a cry of\\r\\nsorrow. \"You are so dear and lovely, and here I\\'ve led you through all\\r\\nthis horrible mess! I don\\'t see how you can ever love me again!\"With one swift movement, as if she had been young again, the mother\\r\\nturned and folded her child in her arms.\"My darling!\" she said. \"Oh, my darling!\" And held her so close she\\r\\ncould hardly breathe.It was a long time they stood so, Marguerite\\'s face hidden in her\\r\\nmother\\'s neck, the mother\\'s lips against her child\\'s hot forehead,\\r\\ntouching her hair with caresses that could not be measured nor counted\\r\\nnor described because it would be a desecration.No words passed between them, nor was there any need.

I thought\\r\\nher the most beautiful, wise, and wonderful person in my world, outside\\r\\nof my home. I treasured her smiles, copied her ways, and listened\\r\\nbreathlessly to all she had to say, sitting at her feet worshipfully\\r\\nwhenever she was near; ready to run any errand for her, no matter how\\r\\nfar.I measured other people by her principles and opinions, and always\\r\\nfelt that her word was final. I am afraid I even corrected my beloved\\r\\nparents sometimes when they failed to state some principle or opinion\\r\\nas she had done.When she came on a visit the house seemed glorified because of her\\r\\npresence; while she remained, life was one long holiday; when she went\\r\\naway it seemed as if a blight had fallen.Her eyes were dark and had interesting twinkles in them that children\\r\\nloved; her hair was long and dark and very heavy, dressed in two wide\\r\\nbraids that were wound round and round her lovely head in smooth coils,\\r\\nfitting close like a cap, but when it was unbraided and brushed out,\\r\\nit fell far below her knees and was like a garment folding her about.'),\n",

Would she think he, too, was in\\r\\nleague against her and be angry? He withdrew still further into the\\r\\ndepths of his paper, and the door swung open and admitted a lady.The secretary jumped up, all smiles.\"Oh, good morning Mrs. Oliver! Aren\\'t you downtown early? Didn\\'t Mr.\\r\\nOliver come with you? I thought he was expecting to be in the office\\r\\nthis morning.

Lippincott Company\\n\\r\\nPrinted in the United States of America\\n\\r\\nFOREWORD\\nAS LONG ago as I can remember there was always a radiant being who was\\r\\nnext to my mother and father in my heart, and who seemed to me to be a\\r\\nsort of a combination of fairy godmother, heroine, and saint. I thought\\r\\nher the most beautiful, wise, and wonderful person in my world, outside\\r\\nof my home. I treasured her smiles, copied her ways, and listened\\r\\nbreathlessly to all she had to say, sitting at her feet worshipfully\\r\\nwhenever she was near; ready to run any errand for her, no matter how\\r\\nfar.I measured other people by her principles and opinions, and always\\r\\nfelt that her word was final. I am afraid I even corrected my beloved\\r\\nparents sometimes when they failed to state some principle or opinion\\r\\nas she had done.When she came on a visit the house seemed glorified because of her\\r\\npresence; while she remained, life was one long holiday; when she went\\r\\naway it seemed as if a blight had fallen.Her eyes were dark and had interesting twinkles in them that children\\r\\nloved; her hair was long and dark and very heavy, dressed in two wide\\r\\nbraids that were wound round and round her lovely head in smooth coils,\\r\\nfitting close like a cap, but when it was unbraided and brushed out,\\r\\nit fell far below her knees and was like a garment folding her about.\\r\\nHow I adored that hair and longed to have hair just like it! How I even\\r\\nused in secret to tie an old brown veil about my head and let it fall\\r\\ndown my back, and try to see how it would feel to have hair like that.She had delicate features and a wonderful smile. Nobody else in the\\r\\nworld looked just as lovely as did she. But once I found a picture of\\r\\nLongfellow\\'s Evangeline in a photograph album, in exquisite classic\\r\\nprofile, and thought it was her likeness. She was like that—if you have\\r\\nthat old faded photograph somewhere in an old album with quaint clasps.\\r\\nShe was wonderful!And she was young, gracious, and very good to be with.This radiant creature was known to me by the name of \"Auntie Belle,\"\\r\\nthough my mother and my grandmother, called her \"Isabella!\" Just like\\r\\nthat! Even sharply sometimes when they disagreed with her—\"Isabella!\" I\\r\\nwondered that they dared. I sometimes resented it.Later I found that other people had still other names for her. To the\\r\\ncongregation of which her husband was pastor she was known as \"Mrs.\\r\\nAlden.\" It seemed to me too grownup a name for her and made her appear\\r\\nmore stately and sedate than she really was. I remember resenting it\\r\\nthat these strange people should seem to have rights in her. She was\\r\\nmine. What were they?But when a little later my world grew larger, and knowledge increased,\\r\\nI found that this precious aunt of mine did not belong entirely to us\\r\\nas I had supposed. She had another world in which she moved and had\\r\\nher being when she went from us from time to time; or when at certain\\r\\nhours in the day she shut herself within a room that was sacredly known\\r\\nas a \"study,\" and wrote for a long time, while we all tried to keep\\r\\nstill; and in this other world of hers she was known as \"Pansy.\" It was\\r\\na world that loved and honored her, a world that gave her homage and\\r\\nflowers, and wrote her letters by the hundreds each week.It was not long, too, before I had learned to preen myself like a young\\r\\npeacock because I \"belonged\" to her, and I am afraid I felt a superior\\r\\npity and contempt for the thousands of other children who read her\\r\\npaper called \"The Pansy\" which she edited, but who did not \"belong\"\\r\\nto her. They could only write letters to her, while I could often be\\r\\nwith her every day, sometimes for weeks, and could talk with her all I\\r\\npleased.As I grew still older and learned to read I devoured her stories\\r\\nchapter by chapter.

How I loved her and hung upon her every word and smile. How\\r\\nproud I was to belong to her! And am still.All these things she did, and yet wrote books! Stories out of real\\r\\nlife, that struck home and showed us to ourselves as God saw us; that\\r\\nsent us to our knees to talk with Him.With marvelous skill she searched hearts, especially of the easy-going\\r\\nChristian, whether minister or layman, young and old, and brought them\\r\\nawake and alive to their inconsistencies. She wove her stories around\\r\\ntheir common, everyday life, till all her characters became alive and\\r\\nreal to those who read. They still live within our memories like people\\r\\nwe have known intimately and dwelt among. Ester Reid and Julia Reid,\\r\\nthe Four Girls at Chautauqua, Mrs. Solomon Smith. I almost expect to\\r\\nmeet some of them in Heaven.Perhaps she wrote more and better because she was doing so eagerly in\\r\\nevery direction. Her public, her church, her family, her home.I wish I might paint you a picture of that home as I knew it; of my\\r\\nhome, its counterpart; of the years the two families spent much time\\r\\ntogether as one family. The days were one long dream. Hard work? Yes,\\r\\nbut good fellowship. Everybody working together with a common aim, and\\r\\njoy in the work and the fellowship!And the evenings! Oh, those evenings, the crown of the days, the time\\r\\nto which we all looked forward as to a goal when our work was done!\\r\\nThose evenings are bright spots in my youth. Especially the evenings\\r\\nof the years we all spent together in Florida, when the sun went\\r\\ndown sharply and the light went velvet black at evening, until the\\r\\ngreat tropical moon came out. Those long evenings when the soft dense\\r\\ndarkness shut us in to a cheerful supper table, and, after we had\\r\\nhustled through the dishes, we all gathered in the big sitting-room\\r\\naround the open fire for family worship. Yes, we were as old-fashioned\\r\\nas that! We had family worship both morning and evening. And I am not\\r\\nof those modern ones who tell such things to scoff at them and say how\\r\\nsick they got of religion because of it, and lay to that their present\\r\\nindifference to God and the Bible. I look back to those times as the\\r\\nmost precious, the most beautiful, the most powerful influence that\\r\\ncame into my life. I thank God for a family that worshipped Him morning\\r\\nand evening and gave me an early knowledge and love for the Bible and\\r\\nthe things of the Kingdom. Either my uncle or my father would conduct\\r\\nthe little service, and often the one or the other of them would say to\\r\\nmy dear aunt: \"You read the chapter to-night, Belle,\" just because she\\r\\nwas such a beautiful reader and we all loved to listen to her. At other\\r\\ntimes, we would recite verses, all around, a verse apiece, and then\\r\\nkneel in a circle for the prayer.Oh, those prayers of the years that made my life inevitably acquainted\\r\\nwith God, and the Lord Jesus, so that I never could be troubled by the\\r\\ndoubts of to-day, because I know Him, \"whom to know is life eternal.\"\\r\\nI cannot be thankful enough for those prayers, and that sacred time of\\r\\nworship every day that brought me into His very Presence.And then the evening that followed!We would all get our work, sewing or drawing, painting or knitting,\\r\\nor embroidery. My father, and my uncle would each take his particular\\r\\nchair in a shaded corner, and a book would be brought out. It was\\r\\nalways a book that had been selected with great care, usually a story,\\r\\nnow and again a great missionary book but more often a good novel.\\r\\nAnd this aunt would usually do the reading. Sometimes my aunt and my\\r\\nmother took turns reading. They both were remarkable readers, and\\r\\nknit close in spirit since early childhood. For two, sometimes three\\r\\nbeautiful hours we reveled in the book. Reluctantly, when the word\\r\\nwent forth that it was time to stop, we folded up our work and went to\\r\\nbed—sometimes pleading for just another chapter—now and then actually\\r\\nstaying up breathless till all hours to finish some great climax. We\\r\\nalways went off to rest with a bright eagerness for the morrow and the\\r\\nevening, and the story again—or a new one if we had finished one.So we read the works of George Macdonald—we loved the Scotch, and our\\r\\nreaders knew how to put the burr of the dialect upon their tongues—Ian\\r\\nMaclaren, Barrie—much of Dickens, some of Scott, Björnson, William Dean\\r\\nHowells, Jean Ingelow\\'s few matchless novels, Frank Stockton, with his\\r\\ncharming absurdities and a host of other writers whose stories seem to\\r\\nhave become submerged and forgotten in this day of modern literature.\\r\\nBut I look back to those stories as my meeting time with the great\\r\\nof the earth. How real the Bonnie Brier Bush and all its quaint true\\r\\npeople were! How tender and strong was the Marquis of Lossie and Sir\\r\\nGibbie! How I thrilled over the \"Men of the Moss Hags,\" \"Ben Hur,\" \"The\\r\\nVirginian,\" \"Jane Eyre.\" I mention them at random. It is my ambition\\r\\nto some day possess in a special set of shelves, every one of those\\r\\nwonderful stories that thrilled me so when I was young. Oh, don\\'t\\r\\ntry to tell me I would not care for them now! I do. They were real\\r\\nbooks, books that do not change because they told of human life as it\\r\\nis really lived in hearts. They may need to be furnished with a few\\r\\nelectric lights and radios and airplanes and automobiles to make them\\r\\nup-to-date, but otherwise you will not find them out of tune with life\\r\\nas it is to-day, except that they are perhaps too clean and wholesome\\r\\nto be natural to-day.There were frequent times when this beloved aunt, around whom we all\\r\\nseemed in those days to center, was called away to deliver an address,\\r\\nor to conduct a conference, or to furnish an evening\\'s entertainment\\r\\nin some distant place; but when she returned from one of these trips\\r\\nwe all gathered around to hear her tell her experiences, for we were\\r\\nalways sure of stories. She saw everything, and she knew how to tell\\r\\nwith glowing words about the days she had been away so that she lived\\r\\nthem over again for us. It was almost better than if we had been along\\r\\nbecause she knew how to bring out the touch of pathos or beauty or fun,\\r\\nand her characters were all portraits. It listened like a book.It was on one of these occasions that she told on her return from\\r\\na trip, the story of this book. I remember it as if it were but\\r\\nyesterday, though the whole thing happened many years ago, for modern\\r\\nas this story is, the main part of it happened, really happened, to her\\r\\npersonal knowledge, over thirty-five years ago.It was told to her by a woman who was so well-known all over our\\r\\ncountry at that time that if I were to name her you could not help\\r\\nbut remember how active she was in Woman\\'s Suffrage and W. C. T. U.\\r\\nwork, besides several other notable reforms and organizations. She was\\r\\na brilliant public speaker, much in demand, and a great worker for\\r\\nyoung girls. She recounted this story to my aunt as a recent personal\\r\\nexperience, and gave her permission to use it in a story (after a\\r\\nsuitable interval of time of course, and without the original names.)The story was written in brief form and appeared several years after\\r\\nits happening in a periodical as a short serial; but it is now\\r\\nappearing in book form for the first time. The dear author, after an\\r\\ninterval of several years, during which on account of ill health and a\\r\\nfeeling that her work was done, has taken up her pen once more. But at\\r\\nwhat odds! She is now eighty-seven years old and confined to her bed,\\r\\nthe result of a fall and a broken hip. In the intervals of pain she has\\r\\nbeen elaborating and preparing this story for book form.And now, because the manuscript was to have been in the hands of the\\r\\npublisher long ago, and because pain has held her in its grip for an\\r\\nunusually long period of weeks lately, leaving her unfit for work for\\r\\nthe present, she has trusted me with the task of putting it into final\\r\\nshape. This story seems to me peculiarly fitting as a message for this\\r\\npresent time.I approach the work with a kind of awe upon me that I should be working\\r\\non her story!If, long ago in my childhood, it had been told me that I should ever be\\r\\ncounted worthy to do this, I would not have believed it. Before her I\\r\\nshall always feel like the little worshipful child I used to be.I recall a Christmas long ago when I was just beginning to write scraps\\r\\nof stories myself, with no thought of ever amounting to anything as a\\r\\nwriter. Her gift to me that year was a thousand sheets of typewriter\\r\\npaper; and in a sweet little note that accompanied it she wished me\\r\\nsuccess and bade me turn those thousand sheets of paper into as many\\r\\ndollars.It was my first real encouragement. The first hint that anybody thought\\r\\nI ever could write, and I laughed aloud at the utter impossibility\\r\\nof its ever coming true. But I feel that my first inspiration for\\r\\nstory-telling came from her, and from reading her books in which as a\\r\\nchild I fairly steeped myself.So I beg the leniency of her readers of to-day as I approach the task\\r\\nthat is set before me. I know I shall have hers. My one hope is that I\\r\\nshall not in any way mar the message of this true and thrilling tale,\\r\\nthat certainly is needed in this day and generation. I trust that she\\r\\nmay soon be well enough to write once more, herself, another tale as\\r\\ngood if not better.Let me tell you a secret. I happen to know that this wonderful little\\r\\nbrave aunt of mine is at work on the story of her younger years. She\\r\\ncalls it \"Yesterdays.\" I have had the pleasure of reading a few of\\r\\nthe earlier chapters where she tells of her childhood and her young\\r\\nwomanhood; the quaint things that happened to her; the dear home\\r\\nin which she lived; the great people of other days whom she knew\\r\\nintimately and with whom she grew up.I pray she may be spared with strength to finish her story of her\\r\\n\"Yesterdays,\" and many more beside.\\r\\nCONTENTS\\nCHAPTER ICHAPTER IICHAPTER IIICHAPTER IVCHAPTER VCHAPTER VICHAPTER VIICHAPTER VIIICHAPTER IXCHAPTER XCHAPTER XICHAPTER XIICHAPTER XIIICHAPTER XIV\\nAN INTERRUPTED NIGHT\\nTHE train had limped along all the afternoon with engine trouble, and\\r\\nnow at evening the passengers learned that they were two hours behind\\r\\nschedule and still losing time.Mrs. Dunlap put away her writing materials and sat up with a sigh to\\r\\nlook about her. It began to look as if she might be going to miss her\\r\\nconnections unless relief from this state of things came soon.She had just finished correcting the last galley of her new book which\\r\\nwas to come out that fall; she had gone over the notes for her new\\r\\naddresses she was on her way to make at several appointed places; she\\r\\nhad finished reading her magazine from cover to cover; she had even\\r\\nwritten a couple of letters to friends; and here she was with time on\\r\\nher hands! An almost unheard of thing for this busy woman. Not many\\r\\nhours of leisure came her way, and when one did, it filled her almost\\r\\nwith dismay at the enforced waste of time.Off in the west a thread of crimson still lingered on the horizon,\\r\\nbut it soon faded into a line of pale amber and then disappeared. The\\r\\nlights of the train blared out and shut the travelers into the narrow\\r\\nconfines of the car, and Mary Dunlap leaned back in her seat and fell\\r\\nto studying her fellow passengers.The usual mother with many children who had been the usual noisy\\r\\nnuisance all the afternoon, had subsided into quiet for the time being;\\r\\nthe mother and the littlest baby being asleep, the rest occupied with a\\r\\npicture book some thoughtful traveler had donated.The personnel of the car had changed somewhat during the afternoon.\\r\\nSeveral people had got out at the stations along the way and others\\r\\nhad come in. Among the latter were the two people who occupied the\\r\\nseat directly in front of Mary Dunlap, and before she realized it,\\r\\nshe was thoroughly absorbed in studying them, her interest caught by\\r\\nthe singularly pure and lovely outline of the young woman\\'s face, in\\r\\nprofile.They were apparently a young married couple, though the man was not so\\r\\nyoung as the girl, who looked entirely too young to be married yet. As\\r\\nshe studied them she could not help wondering over the girl\\'s choice of\\r\\na husband. They did not seem at all well mated. The girl was the far\\r\\nmore attractive of the two.Mary Dunlap decided that they were newly wed. The man had an air of\\r\\nproprietorship which she thought could only be explained by that\\r\\nrelation. To the girl everything seemed to be strange and new, but she\\r\\ndid not wear a happy face.\"Poor child!\" thought the watcher. \"She has just said goodbye to her\\r\\nmother, I suppose.\"Then for a moment, memory carried her swiftly back to the day when she\\r\\nhad been called upon to bid one dear girl the long goodbye.Still, she reflected, on this girl\\'s face there was unrest—real\\r\\nanxiety. There were even moments when she fancied that there was actual\\r\\nfear! What could be the explanation?The husband had been most attentive, almost oppressively so. Could he\\r\\nbe urging her to some course she did not approve?\"The man looks like a gentleman tyrant!\" she told herself. \"He will be\\r\\ncertain to have his own way in the end. That poor child might as well\\r\\nyield first as last.\"The call for dinner in the dining car took her away from their vicinity\\r\\nfor a little while, and before she returned they had followed her to\\r\\nthe diner. But later in the evening when they came back to their seats,\\r\\nshe could not help seeing that they were having some kind of a heated\\r\\nargument, and that the girl was deeply distressed, almost on the verge\\r\\nof tears, the man alternately vexed and cajoling.Mary Dunlap was a woman of wide interests and keen insight into\\r\\ncharacter. She could not help siding with the young wife, and feeling\\r\\nthat the man was in the wrong. He looked like a man who would have his\\r\\nown way at all costs.In vain did she tell herself that she was probably all wrong. The\\r\\ngirl might be a spoiled darling who was childishly insisting on some\\r\\nextravagance which the man, older and wiser, was trying to reason her\\r\\nout of. But try as she would, she could not make it seem that way. The\\r\\nman had a selfish sophistication about him that made her distrust him.Both the young people were well dressed, with that regard to quiet\\r\\nelegance that showed they had plenty of money, and belonged to what is\\r\\nknown as the higher social class. The trouble could not be about money.Mary Dunlap turned her eyes away from them at last, resolved to wonder\\r\\nno more about these strangers who had caught her passing interest. It\\r\\nwas none of her business anyway, what troubled these two. They would\\r\\nhave to settle their own affairs. There was obviously no way in which\\r\\nshe could help them; and perhaps even this kindly observation was a\\r\\nspecies of eavesdropping. She would think no more about them.With her eyes on the dark landscape outside the window, she began to\\r\\nthink about those two hours that the train had lost and to wonder what\\r\\nshe could possibly do about it in case she missed her connection at the\\r\\njunction. Being a methodical woman, and a careful planner she was not\\r\\nused to missing her appointments, and it was most annoying to have the\\r\\ntrain crawl along this way, and then stop for unexplainable periods.\\r\\nNevertheless, there was a certain resignation about her annoyance.\\r\\nShe believed fully that design, not mere chance or Fate determines\\r\\nour ways, and reorders our plannings sometimes, in accordance with\\r\\nAll-seeing wisdom; and she could not help wondering why her plans had\\r\\nbeen put in jeopardy.For a long time she watched the lights of the little villages go flying\\r\\nby, for now the train seemed to have taken up a steady, dogged trot,\\r\\nand rolled along without stopping as if it had made up its mind to get\\r\\nhome sometime.But when she finally turned her gaze back to the car again she could\\r\\nsee that the two in front of her had not settled their argument\\r\\nyet. They were not talking much now, but each face was eloquent of\\r\\ndisagreement. The girl\\'s eyes held unshed tears, and her look was\\r\\nopenly anxious. Now and then she cast a pleading look at her companion,\\r\\nand said a little wistful word, ending in a sigh. The man was still\\r\\nstubbornly positive, his lips curving in a superior smile of amusement\\r\\nat the girl\\'s reiterated objections. Again Mary Dunlap began to realize\\r\\nthat her own interest in the affair was unwarrantably eager. She must\\r\\nstop thinking about these two people or they would pretty soon turn\\r\\naround suddenly and see her staring at them.But just at that instant there occurred a happy interruption. The\\r\\nbrakeman came eagerly through the train as one bearing welcome news,\\r\\nshouting the name of the Junction at last.Mrs. Dunlap sat up briskly and looked at her watch. Ten minutes past\\r\\nmidnight! Would the other train have waited?Capably and quickly she straightened her hat, put on her gloves,\\r\\nbuttoned her coat, gathered her hand bag, brief case, and suit case,\\r\\nand was ready at the door of the car when the train came to a halt.But a glance at the track on the other side of the station showed that\\r\\nthe train had not waited! The station looked deserted and dirty in the\\r\\ndim midnight, and her heart sank. Now, why had this had to happen?Mrs. Dunlap paused for a moment in the doorway of the station as the\\r\\ndisappointed crowds surged from the belated train. They had all more\\r\\nor less of a discouraged look and she sympathized with them. It was\\r\\na new experience to her to be stranded unexpectedly at midnight in a\\r\\nstrange place. Her delay would undoubtedly disappoint many people; but\\r\\nit certainly was not her fault. She had planned carefully as usual,\\r\\nand now must send telegrams in various directions to explain her\\r\\nnon-appearance; her first disappointment as a platform speaker after\\r\\nyears of service. She could not possibly reach her first appointment\\r\\nnow in time and the whole schedule would be thrown out. Too bad, but\\r\\nshe must make the best of it.As she made her way to the telegraph office the man, who had for\\r\\nseveral hours occupied the seat in front of her, brushed past her. He\\r\\ntoo had probably missed connections and must telegraph. She wondered\\r\\nwhere he had left his young wife and wished she might have had a chance\\r\\nto show her some little kindness. She felt strangely drawn to the girl,\\r\\nwho looked too young to be a wife and seemed so utterly troubled.\"I wonder if they are as much disappointed as I am over the upset of\\r\\nplans, and if they are disappointing as many people as I am?\" she said\\r\\nto herself, and again a question came to her mind; \"I wonder why it was\\r\\nallowed to happen? I certainly thought I was needed at that meeting\\r\\nto-morrow morning! They have been planning for it so long! It is so\\r\\nembarrassing to have to disappoint them this way!\"It very soon became necessary however to give undivided attention to\\r\\nthe question of where she was to spend the remainder of the night. The\\r\\nKennard House to which she had been recommended by the ticket agent\\r\\nproved to be crowded and the gentlemanly and sympathetic clerk could\\r\\ngive her no encouragement.He shook his head in response to her question: \"The Albemarle? No, they\\r\\nare as badly off as we are. A car just drove away from here with people\\r\\nwho had tried the Albemarle first. It is certainly an unfortunate night\\r\\nfor that express train to be late! The city is overcrowded on account\\r\\nof the Convention. You are alone, madam? I hardly know what to suggest\\r\\nto you. We let our very last room go, about three minutes before you\\r\\ncame in, to a couple who were your fellow passengers.\"Was that a courteous hint that if she hadn\\'t been so slow in her\\r\\nmovements she might have had their room? Was the fortunate couple the\\r\\ntwo who had held her thoughts for hours? If so, she was glad she had\\r\\nbeen late; that sad-eyed little wife needed a quiet room for getting\\r\\nher nerves under control.Then came another hotel official to exchange a few words in undertone\\r\\nwith the one who was trying to serve her. A moment, then her\\r\\nsympathetic friend turned to her again.\"Madam, I have just heard that the man who engaged No. 38 for the\\r\\nnight, has changed his mind, and is staying with friends in town. If\\r\\nyou cared to wait in the reception room for a few minutes we could have\\r\\nit ready for you.\"Grateful thanks were of course the only reply to make to this.As she took up the pen to register Mrs. Dunlap remarked: \"It seems\\r\\nalmost foolish to register for the few hours there are left of the\\r\\nnight.\" But she said it with a genial smile and the friendly air that\\r\\nmade clerks and porters and all who served her, glad to offer a helping\\r\\nhand.The name just preceding her own held her attention as probably the one\\r\\nthat belonged to the couple who had so continually interested her that\\r\\nevening. \"R. H. Keller and wife.\" They were booked for Room 537. That\\r\\nmust be four floors above her own. She wished they had been nearer,\\r\\nthen she might have opportunity to exchange courtesies with that\\r\\nfrightened little bride; if she could only mother her a little, she\\r\\nwould be glad.The parlor in which she waited looked vast and gloomy in its midnight\\r\\ndimness and solitude. No not quite solitude, there were other\\r\\noccupants, a man and woman, probably waiting like herself for a room to\\r\\nbe made ready. Her first impulse was to choose a corner as far removed\\r\\nfrom them as space would permit. Instead, she took possession of one\\r\\nof the couches quite near where they were standing for she suddenly\\r\\nrecognized them as her traveling companions, and her interest in the\\r\\ngirl flamed anew as she caught sight of her face.What could be troubling that girl! The more she saw of the man\\'s\\r\\nface the more she distrusted him. Perhaps she imagined it, but it\\r\\nseemed as though he had recognized her close proximity with a frown!\\r\\nNevertheless, she determined not to retreat. What if there should be\\r\\na chance just to speak a cheery word to the girl? She tucked herself\\r\\namong the cushions, drew her coat closely about her, and seemed to\\r\\nsleep, but she had never felt wider awake. Her nervousness was taking\\r\\nthe form of a premonition.The man had turned toward his wife. \"We may as well be comfortable\\r\\nwhile we wait,\" he said. \"It is beastly luck to have to wait at all.\\r\\nThese second class towns never have proper hotel accommodations. Let us\\r\\ngo over to that couch at the other end of the room where the pillows\\r\\nlook less stinted.\"The girl looked over at the distant couch then glanced back to the one\\r\\nwhere Mrs. Dunlap rested.\"Oh, no,\" she said, moving nearer to the fireplace. \"I am chilly;\\r\\nI would rather stay here. Suppose you push a couple of those large\\r\\nrocking chairs up this way?\"\"I can make you much more comfortable on the couch,\" he said, his tone\\r\\nindicating annoyance. \"That fire will not keep you warm, there is\\r\\nnothing left of it but charred old stumps. Do let me snug you up among\\r\\nthe cushions.\"He essayed to pass an arm about her as he spoke, but she drew away from\\r\\nhim with a wan smile as she said:\"I would rather stay here; it seems less lonely to be near a woman. Why\\r\\ndid we trouble about rooms? I think I would just as soon stay where I\\r\\nam?\"\"Standing?\" he asked in a tone which to the woman on the couch sounded\\r\\nsullen.\"No,\" answered the girl with that pitiful attempt at a smile, \"I would\\r\\nbe willing to sit if you would bring up chairs. There cannot be much\\r\\nlonger to wait, I should think. What time did you say we could get a\\r\\ntrain?\"When he told her, the response was almost a wail.\"Oh, Rufus! That was not what you said before? Why, that is not until\\r\\nanother day!\"The woman on the couch held herself motionless by a strong effort of\\r\\nwill. This was not the tone of a happy wife! She was certain now that\\r\\nsomething was wrong besides a few hours of delay. This was more like\\r\\nthe outbreak of a woman half afraid of the man who was supposed to be\\r\\ncaring for her.\"It is beastly luck,\" the man said again. \"Something is always the\\r\\nmatter on this confounded branch road! If you hadn\\'t been staying in\\r\\nsuch an out of the way place, we should have been saved all this.\\r\\nStill, I don\\'t understand why we should make it any more uncomfortable\\r\\nthan it is. You ought to be resting quietly, instead—\"Her voice interrupted him, louder than it had been before. \"I cannot\\r\\nrest: I cannot! I can only think of my mother\\'s utter dismay and—and\\r\\nterror when she hears—\"\"H-sh!\" The man\\'s sibilant whisper was sudden and fierce!No wonder the girl started, and cried out in fright: \"Oh, what is it!\"He bent over her and spoke lower.\"It is nothing at all, my dear, except that you are utterly tired out\\r\\nand your nerves are on edge. But you must be careful what you say.\\r\\nThat confounded eavesdropper has planted herself as close to us as she\\r\\ncould, and may get the idea from your words that I am a fiend of some\\r\\nkind. Thank goodness, though, she has gone to sleep, at last! I must\\r\\nsay they are taking an unaccountable time to get that room ready.\"\"That room!\" repeated the still frightened voice. \"There are two rooms,\\r\\nof course?\"\"Of course,\" he repeated hastily, \"but I could wait for mine, you know.\"\"I don\\'t like it,\" the girl said, quite as if she had not heard him,\\r\\n\"I don\\'t like anything about it! I wish—Oh, Rufus, can\\'t we go on\\r\\nto-night? Or go somewhere and talk things over and make other plans. I\\r\\ndon\\'t want any room!\"He spoke kindly but with great firmness.\"That is impossible, dear, as you will realize when you think a moment.\\r\\nAll the arrangements are made, and my friend is waiting and will be\\r\\nthere for the next train. There is no other train until morning that\\r\\nwill do us any good. Why can you not be the sensible girl you have been\\r\\nall the afternoon and let me do the extra planning that this detention\\r\\nhas made necessary? I assure you I can take care of you.\" As he spoke,\\r\\nhe tried to draw her nearer.She made a despairing movement away from him and said:\"Oh, I cannot make you understand! I know how strange it seems to you,\\r\\nbut if you could think for a moment of my side of it! Can\\'t you realize\\r\\nhow different it will all be to me when I have the right to be with\\r\\nyou anywhere and always? As it is, I cannot help feeling strangely\\r\\nalone and—and almost disgraced! I do, Rufus, I cannot help it. Mother\\r\\nhas always been so particular about me; and she would think this that\\r\\nwe are doing was terrible! I know now that she would. Can\\'t we go\\r\\nsomewhere on the cars, and talk it all over? I don\\'t feel so perfectly\\r\\nstrange when we are moving. Hark! Was that one o\\'clock? And we were to\\r\\nhave been there long before twelve! And you were to telegraph to mother\\r\\nearly in the morning! Oh, this is dreadful!\"He bent toward her and spoke gently. \"Daisy, listen, you are making\\r\\nyourself ill over troubles that do not exist. Everything is all right;\\r\\nwe shall be in by noon, and my friend will meet the train. Meantime in\\r\\nthe early morning I will wire your mother, as we planned; and—\"She interrupted him. \"But we don\\'t get in until noon! And what you were\\r\\ngoing to say won\\'t be true!\"\"Oh, nonsense! Why, my dear, if you were not so tired as to be beyond\\r\\nreasoning, I could convince you in a very few minutes of the folly of\\r\\nthat! I shall only be anticipating the truth by a very few hours in\\r\\norder to relieve her anxiety.\"\"Rufus, I cannot help it. I cannot have our life together begin with\\r\\nfalsehood! It is bad enough as it is. I cannot help being sorry that we\\r\\ndid not wait until mother had a chance to know you better. She is not a\\r\\nhard or unreasonable woman.\"\"I see plainly that you do not trust me.\" He spoke with such bitterness\\r\\nand sharpness that the listener on the couch who could catch only\\r\\nportions of the girl\\'s words, felt as though she would like to spring\\r\\nup that minute and defend her. But the voice rose clearer just then.\"Rufus! How can you say that to me? If I had not trusted you utterly,\\r\\nwould I be here to-night? If you had a mother, you would understand how\\r\\nperfectly dreadful it is to—\"As she hesitated for words, a hotel official came towards them.\"Are you Mr. R. H. Keller, sir? If so, you are wanted at the office\\r\\ntelephone.\"\"Confound the fellow!\" muttered Keller. Then, in a gentler tone, \"Don\\'t\\r\\nlet that frighten you, Daisy. It is a business call that I have been\\r\\nexpecting; but it comes at an inopportune time, of course. I shall be\\r\\nback in a very few minutes.\"Left to herself, the girl walked back and forth in front of the fire,\\r\\nseeming to catch her breath in convulsive little sobs. She was so near\\r\\nthe couch that Mrs. Dunlap could have put out her hand and touched her.\\r\\nWhen that good woman saw a pair of small hands clenched and heard a low\\r\\nmoan, she came suddenly to a sitting posture and in a moment more was\\r\\nspeaking in a low tone.\"Will you forgive me, dear? I am the mother of a precious girl who was\\r\\nabout your age when God called her home. And I miss her so! I cannot\\r\\nhelp seeing that you are in trouble. May I not play mother to you for a\\r\\nlittle while and try to comfort you?\"But the girl\\'s face at that moment expressed such abject terror, that\\r\\nshe made haste to add:\"There is nothing to be frightened over, dear; this is a quiet,\\r\\nentirely respectable house, and your husband will be back in a few\\r\\nmoments.\" It was the probing word that this student of human nature had\\r\\nresolved should open her way, and it succeeded.\"He is not my husband!\" the girl exclaimed. \"Not yet,\" she added\\r\\nquickly. \"We were to have been married as soon as the train reached our\\r\\ndestination; but the train was delayed; we could not go on; and there\\r\\nwere no rooms to be had without this awful waiting! I wish now that we\\r\\nhad not—\" She stopped abruptly, then began again.\"I know I must appear very silly indeed to a stranger. But I cannot\\r\\nseem to help it. And I cannot explain, either, why it should suddenly\\r\\nseem so perfectly dreadful to me, but it does! I am so used to\\r\\ntraveling with my mother; I cannot get away from the thought of how\\r\\nperfectly awful it would seem to her if she knew that I—\"The tremulous voice stopped again; and at that moment Mrs. Dunlap felt\\r\\nthat she could almost enjoy shooting the man who had deliberately\\r\\nplanned such a state of things for this frightened child. She passed a\\r\\nprotecting arm about the trembling form and spoke low and tenderly.\"My child, will you trust me and tell me all about it? You remind me of\\r\\nmy own dear daughter; I am sure that you have a precious mother. Does\\r\\nshe know that you expected to be married to-night?\"\"No, oh, no! She doesn\\'t dream of such a thing! We couldn\\'t tell her\\r\\nbecause she—she is prejudiced against Mr. Keller; he has enemies, we\\r\\nthink, who are trying to injure him because he is a more successful man\\r\\nthan they are, and she—Why, she wasn\\'t even willing to have me walk\\r\\nout with him, alone! But I thought—I mean I think that when we are\\r\\nmarried, and everything is settled forever, we shall be able to make\\r\\nher understand. It really isn\\'t as though I were a child; I am of age.\"At this, the child-woman drew herself up with such a pitiful attempt at\\r\\nwomanhood that Mrs. Dunlap, under happier circumstances, felt sure she\\r\\nwould have asked how many hours it was since the child had attained to\\r\\nthat dignity!The tremulous voice continued:\"Still, I could not live without my mother; and I do not need to, of\\r\\ncourse. As soon as she discovers how truly good and noble Mr. Keller\\r\\nis, and what a devoted son he is ready to be to her, it will be all\\r\\nright. Mother has always wanted a son.\"A note of appeal had crept into her voice as though she longed to hear\\r\\nfrom even this stranger an assurance that all would be well. Mrs.\\r\\nDunlap\\'s mother-heart bled for her, and a throb of thankfulness for the\\r\\nabsolute safety of her own daughter thrilled through her. With it came\\r\\nthe determination to do what she could to help this girl, even at the\\r\\ncost of a possible mistake.\"My child,\" she said, \"I feel that I must tell you something that I\\r\\nthink you ought to know. You are registered at this hotel as \\'R. H.\\r\\nKeller and wife!\\' And one room—not two—is being made ready for you.\"FOR a moment Mrs. Dunlap regretted her words. The terror in the\\r\\ngirl\\'s eyes transformed her face; and the low cry she gave was almost\\r\\nlike that of a wounded animal! But she rallied rapidly and said with\\r\\neagerness: \"Oh, you are mistaken! It is some other person whose name\\r\\nyou have mistaken for his. He would not—why, Rufus could not do such a\\r\\nthing!\"\"My dear child, I am not mistaken.\" The very quietness of the woman\\'s\\r\\nvoice and manner carried conviction. \"The name is R. H. Keller and the\\r\\nman who is with you here to-night is the one who sat before me with you\\r\\nyesterday afternoon, and wrote his name as I have told you, just before\\r\\nI did on the register.\"Suddenly the poor girl broke into bitter weeping. \"What shall I do!\"\\r\\nshe wailed. \"Oh, what shall I do! Oh, mother! If I had never gone away\\r\\nfrom you! I have killed her! I have killed my mother!\"\"No, you haven\\'t!\" Mrs. Dunlap\\'s voice had never been quieter, nor\\r\\nfirmer. \"You are going home to her this morning, as soon as the train\\r\\ngoes. In a few hours she will have her arms about you. And when you are\\r\\nreally being married, she will stand very near you, and be the first\\r\\nto kiss you, and call you her darling. You wouldn\\'t disappoint her for\\r\\nanything! Come with me to my room and wait until train time. There\\r\\nought to be one very early in the morning, and I will see you safely to\\r\\nit.\"The girl seized the little hand bag she had dropped, and spoke\\r\\nhurriedly.\"Where is the room? Oh, quick! Take me to it, will you? That was what\\r\\nI wanted; a place to be alone and think. I don\\'t know what I can do,\\r\\nbut I must decide; and I must do it before Mr. Keller comes back,\\r\\nbecause—oh, will you let me go into your room and lock the door?\"They both turned hurriedly at the sound of footsteps.It was a porter to say that No. 37 was ready; and never were fleeter\\r\\nsteps than those that followed his lead.\"Oh, hurry!\" the girl said breathlessly as they reached the room, and\\r\\nit was she who turned the key in the lock after the retreating porter.\\r\\nThen she dropped a limp heap into the nearest chair and cried.Mrs. Dunlap left her quite to herself and thanked God for the tears.\"What shall I do if he comes and demands to be let in?\" the girl asked\\r\\nsuddenly, looking up at her deliverer. \"He is so—so masterful; and he\\r\\ndoes not look at things as I do. He thinks that a few hours cannot make\\r\\nany difference. I know how he argued it out with himself that he could\\r\\nnot leave me alone, and that he would shield my name by giving me his\\r\\nin advance, but I cannot do it, I cannot! And if he comes and insists\\r\\nupon talking to me, I don\\'t know what will become of me. I don\\'t seem\\r\\nto be able to make him understand.\"\"I know, dear; you will be a good girl and go back to your mother. Of\\r\\ncourse you cannot do what he wants. This is my room; he will hardly\\r\\ncome to it without my permission. If you think it is necessary to\\r\\nexplain your absence, I will go down to him, if you will let me, and\\r\\nexplain what is necessary.\"\"Oh, if you will! I mean if you can! He is very determined; and he is\\r\\nused to having his own way; I cannot think that he will let me—\"She was trembling so violently that she could scarcely speak.Mrs. Dunlap passed an arm about her and spoke as she might have done to\\r\\na frightened child.\"Don\\'t think about that part of it any more; I am not in the least\\r\\nafraid of him; and I will take care of you! Have you a kimono in this\\r\\nbag? Let me help you take off your dress, just as your mother would,\\r\\nand slip the kimono on for a little while. I have been looking at the\\r\\ntime table. You can have almost three hours of quiet; then I will take\\r\\nyou to the train. We can plan all the details afterwards.\"\"Oh, you are so kind!\" murmured the girl.\"I am going downstairs now,\" the woman said when the girl had submitted\\r\\nto her ministrations, resisting the suggestion about the bed, but\\r\\nallowing herself to be propped among pillows in an easy chair. \"I will\\r\\ncome back in a little while; or would you rather have this room quite\\r\\nto yourself? I can be comfortable down on one of the couches, and I\\r\\nwill come for you in ample time for the train.\"\"No! Oh, no!\" the girl said, the look of fear coming into her eyes\\r\\nagain. \"Please don\\'t leave me! And yet you must! Would you mind locking\\r\\nthe door and taking the key with you? I cannot help a feeling that—\"\"She is afraid of him!\" was Mrs. Dunlap\\'s mental comment as she sped\\r\\ndown the hall with the key in her pocket.On the whole she decided she was rather glad of an opportunity to tell\\r\\nthat man what she thought of him.She had little time to collect her thoughts, for the subject of them\\r\\nhurried in soon after she entered the parlor.There was an ugly frown on his face. Evidently the interview from which\\r\\nhe had just come had irritated him.He strode to the corner where he had left his companion and stared\\r\\nabout him perplexedly; then turned an angry questioning look upon Mrs.\\r\\nDunlap.\"Are you looking for the lady who was here when you left the room?\" She\\r\\nasked pleasantly, determined to be courteous if possible. \"She has gone\\r\\nto my room to get some rest, and asked me to say to you that she is all\\r\\nright and quite comfortable for the night.\"He strode toward her with a glare in his eyes that would have\\r\\nfrightened a less courageous spirit, and spoke in an angry voice: \"Who\\r\\nare you that you presume to interfere in the lady\\'s affairs?\" he said\\r\\nhaughtily. \"I have a room for her to rest in, and you will oblige me\\r\\nby telling her that I am waiting for her, and then by minding your own\\r\\nbusiness.\"Mrs. Dunlap had the advantage of this angry man; she was perfectly cool\\r\\nand calm.\"You are mistaken,\" she said. \"I have the right to interfere, because\\r\\nthe lady has claimed my protection and I am abundantly able and willing\\r\\nto give it.\"\"Protection from what!\" he thundered.\"From Mr. Keller, I fancy. I supposed, of course, that the lady in\\r\\nquestion was your wife, as I had seen you together during the day, and\\r\\nnoticed how you registered. Since she has informed me that she is not;\\r\\nand, furthermore, that she does not wish to see you again to-night, I\\r\\nhave aided her in carrying out her wishes and must insist on her not\\r\\nbeing disturbed.\"\"Must you indeed! How do you expect to accomplish the task of keeping\\r\\nme away from the lady who is under my protection, and for whom I alone\\r\\nam responsible?\"There was menace in his tone and in the glare of his eyes. Mrs. Dunlap\\r\\nlifted her eyebrows with a gesture of contempt, but she spoke quietly.\"This is absurd, Mr. Keller. I have no wish to make matters more\\r\\nuncomfortable than is necessary; but of course you are aware that this\\r\\nis a respectable house. You are here in company with a young woman whom\\r\\nyou registered as your wife; and you ordered a room for yourself and\\r\\nher; but she says that she is not your wife, and that she does not wish\\r\\nto see you again to-night. I do not need to remind you how promptly\\r\\nthe proprietor of this house, as well as its guests, would come to\\r\\nher aid if necessary; nor that policemen and lockups are conveniences\\r\\nwithin call. If you compel me to resort to such measures, you will have\\r\\nyourself to thank.\"There was something about Mary Dunlap when she chose to assert herself\\r\\nthat commanded respect. Keller looked into the clear stern eyes of\\r\\nthis woman and realized that he must not go too far. He glared at her,\\r\\nbaffled for an instant, and when she still continued to look steadily\\r\\nat him, he wheeled and took a few steps away from her. Then, after a\\r\\nmoment, with a sound that was evidently an attempt at a laugh but was\\r\\nmore like a sneer, he turned and came toward her again, trying to speak\\r\\nlightly:\"You women are too much for me! I may as well take you into my\\r\\nconfidence, as the lady has evidently seen fit to do. It is true that\\r\\nthe formal ceremony which was to have made us man and wife in the eyes\\r\\nof a curious world has not yet taken place, but the mere formality\\r\\nis all that is lacking. If it were not for a wrecked engine and this\\r\\ninfernal delay, Mrs. Grundy, whom you are personifying, would have\\r\\nbeen able to sleep peacefully. I registered as I had expected to do\\r\\nafter I had reached the station where the clergyman was waiting for\\r\\nus, because I did not wish to leave the lady alone, in her wearied,\\r\\nand nervous state, but desired to minister to her comfort, as I would\\r\\nassuredly have been able to do, had we not been interfered with in this\\r\\nextraordinary manner. I did not consider it necessary to explain to the\\r\\nlady that I had anticipated the ceremony by a few hours, in writing her\\r\\nname as mine, and thus securing a quiet room for her to rest in.\"I may further say that business complications in which a good deal of\\r\\nmoney was involved, have made it necessary for me to move with caution\\r\\nin this entire matter, and for this reason I brought her away with me\\r\\nquietly, before the outward forms had been complied with; but she came\\r\\nwithout coercion of any sort as she will be ready to inform you, if\\r\\nyou explain that you suspect me of being at least an accomplice in a\\r\\ncase of kidnapping! She will tell you also that she is of age, and that\\r\\nnobody living has a right to object to her taking a journey at any hour\\r\\nof the day or night with her chosen husband.\"Now, having, I am sure, satisfied the utmost demands of your\\r\\ncuriosity, if you will tell me where to find the lady, I will escort\\r\\nher to her private sitting-room; and you need not delay your own sleep\\r\\nany longer. If it will comfort you to know it, I assure you that three\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation with my lady, will be sufficient to allay any\\r\\nfears that you may have succeeded in working up.\"This biting sarcasm, partially veiled at times by mock courtesy, was\\r\\nconcluded with what was intended to be a bow of dismissal.But Mrs. Dunlap was never more quietly determined in her course of\\r\\naction. Every word that the man had spoken increased her distrust of\\r\\nhim.\"We need not argue,\" she said. \"You have told me nothing that I did\\r\\nnot know before. Let me remind you that the mere formality which is\\r\\nstill lacking to give you the legal right to take care of this woman\\r\\nis one that decent people still carefully adhere to, and without it\\r\\nyour action to-night has been contrary to law and respectability.\\r\\nFor this reason, no matter what your motive is, or how many private\\r\\nsitting-rooms you have been able to secure in this overcrowded house,\\r\\nI can and will protect the young woman from occupying one of them. I\\r\\nsuppose it is hardly necessary to add that if you make the slightest\\r\\nattempt to see her to-night, or to interfere with her wishes in any\\r\\nway, I shall not hesitate to take the hotel officials and the police\\r\\ninto my confidence. If you force me to action, you will find that I am\\r\\na woman who is very well-known.\"During these words the man\\'s face was a study. Fierce indignation,\\r\\ndoubt, perplexity, intense disgust, each struggled for the ascendancy.\\r\\nBut Mrs. Dunlap was about to leave the room. The necessity for\\r\\npropitiating her in some way forced itself upon him.\"Wait!\" he said imperatively. \"You do not understand. Is it possible to\\r\\nmake you understand the conditions? Sit down and let me explain just\\r\\nwhat has happened, and what I am trying to do.\"His manner became suddenly courteous, and he began to talk volubly,\\r\\nexplaining, in more minute detail than the occasion seemed to call for,\\r\\nthe devious ways by which he had reached this point; enlarging upon\\r\\nhis deep affection for the lady of his choice, and his desire to free\\r\\nher from the narrow and cramped life in which he found her. Her mother\\r\\nwas a commonplace, narrow-minded, exceedingly prejudiced person who\\r\\nentirely dominated her daughter\\'s life; so that she was in danger of\\r\\nhaving no individuality, he said.Among other proofs of the mother\\'s folly, she had conceived a violent\\r\\ndislike to himself; and carried her tyranny to such an extent that the\\r\\ngirl was not even allowed to receive a call from him, unless the mother\\r\\nwas present! Matters were in this state, and he was at an utter loss\\r\\nhow to further the daughter\\'s interests, when his good angel, came to\\r\\nhis rescue. The girl went to spend a month with a very intimate friend,\\r\\nwho had married and removed to a town a hundred miles from her home.\\r\\nThen, quite unexpectedly to himself, business connected with his firm\\r\\nsent him to that very town. All the rest had followed, almost, he might\\r\\nsay, because of the necessities of the case. He had discovered that\\r\\nthe young lady\\'s affections were as deeply involved as his own, and\\r\\nthat she despaired, as deeply as he did himself, of ever winning her\\r\\nnarrow-minded mother to take their view of things.Mrs. Dunlap was called upon to assent to the statement that common\\r\\npeople were apt to have violent prejudices for which they could not\\r\\naccount, and were the hardest persons on earth to move. Still, he would\\r\\nadmit that in carrying out the program that followed he had acted upon\\r\\nsudden impulse rather than premeditated plans.When the time came for the lady to return home, Providence seemed to\\r\\nmake a way for them to be happy. He need not explain that he had used\\r\\nno coercion in the matter; the lady realized only too certainly that\\r\\nher mother stood in the way of her happiness, and that if she had her\\r\\nway, the daughter would be entirely and forever separated from him.\\r\\nThis, she felt that she could not endure, and they both believed that,\\r\\nwhen the irrevocable step was taken, the mother would have a return\\r\\nto common sense. So, in a moment, one might say, it was all arranged;\\r\\nindeed it almost arranged itself. He had a friend in the ministry at a\\r\\ntown which was an important junction of the railroad, and to him, he\\r\\nsent a message planning all the necessary details; but for the horrible\\r\\ndelay because of that disabled engine, everything would have been\\r\\ncomplete.But the delay and confusion and the necessity for their stopping\\r\\novernight at a strange hotel had bewildered and frightened the girl,\\r\\nunused as she was to being alone, or to thinking and planning for\\r\\nherself. It was the knowledge of that, which had led him to make the\\r\\nmistake of registering as he did; he could now see that it was a\\r\\nmistake. He knew there was but one room to be had, and his only thought\\r\\nhad been to secure privacy for her and the right to minister to her\\r\\ncomfort. At the moment there seemed no other way; but he would admit\\r\\nthat it had a bad look to others, who did not understand the situation.\\r\\nFor himself these outward conventions never seemed of paramount\\r\\nimportance so long as one understood one\\'s self. He had not meant to\\r\\ntell the girl about it, because she, as a matter of course having such\\r\\na mother, was terribly trammeled by conventions of all sorts and could\\r\\nnot be made to understand that what was true IN SPIRIT was the same as\\r\\ntruth.But, he had been foolish; he was ready to admit it. He was even\\r\\ngrateful for her interference, when he came to think carefully,\\r\\nalthough he would confess that at first it seemed unpardonable. He had\\r\\nbeen a law to himself for so many years, that he knew he did not attach\\r\\nthe same importance to convention that others did, but he must learn\\r\\nto do so now, for the girl\\'s sake. Of course everything should be as\\r\\nshe wished. He would not for the world go contrary to the lady\\'s real\\r\\ndesires, but it would be necessary for him to see her and rearrange\\r\\ntheir program. After he had learned just what she wanted him to do, he\\r\\nwould spend the remainder of the night in long distance communications,\\r\\nbecause of course there were explanations that must be made. Having\\r\\ninterested herself in his charge, would she be so kind as to tell her\\r\\nthat he was waiting for her, and must confer with her at once in order\\r\\nto send his dispatches? He would detain her but a very short time, and\\r\\nthen she could return to the room that had been so kindly placed at her\\r\\ndisposal.Throughout this elaborate explanation Mrs. Dunlap had sat silent;\\r\\nher eyes fixed upon the speaker, and her thoughts busy with this new\\r\\nspecimen of human nature.Not for a single moment did he deceive her into thinking that he was,\\r\\nin the main, a true man who, because of his love for a pretty girl\\r\\nand the sudden temptation of opportunity, had been led headlong into\\r\\na foolish and dangerous experiment. Not for an instant did she waver\\r\\nin her determination to keep those two apart, if possible, until the\\r\\ngirl\\'s mother could make a third in their deliberations.Yet she made no attempt to interrupt the flow of words, and grew\\r\\ninterested in the skill with which he was explaining the unexplainable.When he paused, with an evident air of having mastered a difficult\\r\\nsituation, she said:\"You are very kind to give me details, although they do not of course\\r\\nalter the present situation. It is a relief to know that you consider\\r\\nyour course wrong, but I cannot agree with your way of trying to right\\r\\nit. I have given my word to the lady that she shall not be disturbed\\r\\nto-night and that she shall take the home-bound train in the morning.\\r\\nAfter she is safe at home with her mother and has had time to rally\\r\\nfrom the shock that this has evidently been to her, you may be able to\\r\\nmake such plans as neither of you will be ashamed to look back upon;\\r\\nbut she is in no condition to be consulted to-night; and it may help\\r\\nyou to realize, what I feel quite sure of, that she has had her lesson,\\r\\nand that any future plans you may care to make must take her mother\\r\\ninto full consideration. You will pardon the suggestion that you must\\r\\nhave had many more years than she, in which to learn wisdom; she is but\\r\\neighteen I believe, while you—\"She paused significantly, but the man whom she judged to be not less\\r\\nthan thirty-five at least, was speechless with amazement and dismay. He\\r\\nhad staked much and expected to win.She turned and left him before he could think of any excuse to detain\\r\\nher longer.THE remainder of the night was as unique in its way as its earlier\\r\\nhours had been. On Mary Dunlap\\'s return to her room she found the girl\\r\\nwas more composed, and able to talk quietly.\"I have had time to think it all out,\" she said, when Mrs. Dunlap had\\r\\ntold what she meant to tell. \"Mr. Keller does not understand; his\\r\\nmother died when he was a child and he brought himself up, in a way. He\\r\\nhas been a law to himself and to others for so long that he just goes\\r\\nahead and does what seems best to him. I am sure he meant right. Even\\r\\nthat strange part about registering,\" her face flushed as she spoke,\\r\\n\"I can see it was done for my sake. I am so lacking in self-reliance\\r\\nand had been so nervous all day that he felt he could not trust me\\r\\nalone, and took that way of caring for me. But it is no wonder that I\\r\\nam nervous, for I have been doing wrong all day! I did not know it; I\\r\\nthought because I was of age I had a right to decide for myself but\\r\\nI realize that there is a higher law than just a legal one, and I am\\r\\ngoing home to mother! I am afraid she will feel that she can never\\r\\ntrust me out of her sight again, and I do not deserve to be trusted.\"It is all very plain to me now, what I ought to do. I shall write to\\r\\nMr. Keller and tell him that we must wait, and give my mother time to\\r\\nknow him, and to learn what a truly noble man he is. Then we must try\\r\\nby all honorable means to win her consent to our marriage. I will not\\r\\ncannot be married till my mother feels right about it.\"\"I think that sounds like a very wise decision,\" said Mary Dunlap with\\r\\nrelief in her voice. \"That is what mothers were given for, to help in\\r\\ngrave decisions. They seem to have a sort of God-given intuition about\\r\\nthe great critical things of life. Remember that if you do not succeed\\r\\nin winning her over, such a mother, as a girl like you must have,\\r\\nsurely must have wise reasons for objecting—\"\"Oh, I\\'m sure we will succeed,\" interrupted the girl\\'s voice anxiously.\\r\\n\"My mother wants nothing in this world so much as my happiness. But if\\r\\nwe cannot, after a reasonable time, convince her that he is worthy of\\r\\nher trust, why then we must just be married, without her consent. I\\r\\nhave my own life to live—\" she drew herself up proudly with a pitiful\\r\\nassumption of dignity—\"I cannot afford to spoil my life and his for the\\r\\nsake of a cruel prejudice.\"This last was so manifestly an echo from Mr. Keller\\'s philosophy that\\r\\nthe listener said not a word, in response, and the eager voice went on.\"But we must do it honestly; there shall be no slipping away as though\\r\\nwe were ashamed! I cannot understand how I could have done such a\\r\\nthing! Doesn\\'t it seem strange that I should know now just what to do,\\r\\nwhen this morning I did not at all! And so, dear friend—you will be my\\r\\nfriend always, will you not? And mother will never know how to thank\\r\\nyou enough for what you have done for me to-night! If you will put me\\r\\non the train in the morning, as you said, I will go directly home; no\\r\\nmatter how many broken engines hinder.\"Mrs. Dunlap tried by all conceivable devices to induce her charge to\\r\\nget some sleep. She rang for a porter and made careful arrangements\\r\\nfor the early train; planning the minutest details with a view to\\r\\nconvincing the girl that she might be trusted. But there was no sleep\\r\\nto be had for either of them. Her charge was docile enough; she lay\\r\\ndown obediently and closed her eyes; but she started at every sound,\\r\\nand imagined sounds that were not; frequently, after a few minutes\\r\\nof silence, she would break into eager explanations of some of Mr.\\r\\nKeller\\'s movements, with a view to placing him in the best possible\\r\\nlight.\"What is his business?\" Mrs. Dunlap asked; deciding, after fruitless\\r\\neffort that to humor the child\\'s restlessness was perhaps the better\\r\\nway.\"He is—I—don\\'t know—!\"The sentence began eagerly, then a pause, and the half bewildered\\r\\nconclusion.\"He has to travel a great deal,\" she added; \"belongs to a firm, you\\r\\nknow; but I find that I do not know what the firm is; it seems strange\\r\\nthat I never thought to ask him!\"\"Is his home in the West?\"\"Yes—no, he is there winters; summers he is East somewhere. I don\\'t\\r\\nremember which city he calls \\'home\\'; he is in New York a great deal. He\\r\\nreally hasn\\'t much home I presume; an unmarried man, whose parents are\\r\\ndead; it must be very dreary.\"\"Poor innocent child!\" was Mrs. Dunlap\\'s mental comment. \"She really\\r\\nknows no more about the man than I do; I\\'m afraid not so much! For all\\r\\nthat she could prove, he might be an adventurer of the sort that is\\r\\ncareful not to have a settled home.\"But all that she put into words was an earnest admonition to the girl\\r\\nto try to rest. For herself, she did not mean to sleep; every nerve was\\r\\non the alert for a possible invasion. Who could be sure of what that\\r\\ndefeated plotter might attempt?But the night passed without further incident and early morning found\\r\\nthe two at the telegraph office, from which presently two messages sped\\r\\non their way. One read:\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"Delayed by disabled engine. Coming on No. 2. All safe. Daisy.\"\\n\\nIt had taken nearly half an hour to compose this message\\r\\nsatisfactorily. The other read:\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"Must fail you for Wednesday. Will give you Thursday instead,\\r\\nif desired. Wire me at Winfield. Mary Dunlap.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dunlap had decided that the personal deposit of this young girl at\\r\\nher mother\\'s door was more important than any other \"woman\\'s work\" that\\r\\nshe could do that day although she did not know that the man she had\\r\\nfoiled was already seated in the smoker of the early train, waiting for\\r\\nher to disappear. She utterly distrusted him, and felt instinctively\\r\\nthat he would watch his opportunity.It was to the girl\\'s great astonishment that, having established her\\r\\ncharge in comfort, Mrs. Dunlap prepared to seat herself in the opposite\\r\\nchair.\"Oh, are you really going this way?\" said the unsuspecting child. \"What\\r\\nmade me think that you were going farther West? How far do you go? To\\r\\nWinfield? Why, that is just beyond my station! How lovely! You will\\r\\nstop and see mother and let her thank you herself, won\\'t you?\"But Mrs. Dunlap had decided that she would not. If the man were only a\\r\\nfool, and not a confirmed villain, and the child\\'s heart was bound up\\r\\nin him, it were better for all concerned that her prejudices, as well\\r\\nas her knowledge of that tragic night, should never reach the mother\\'s\\r\\nears.When the journey was over and they drove to the girl\\'s home, she waited\\r\\nonly to clasp hands with the sweet-faced, low-voiced, grateful woman,\\r\\ninto whose eager arms Daisy flung herself, and to decline the pressing\\r\\ninvitation to the home that wanted to shower kindnesses upon her; then\\r\\nsped on to Winfield. Arrived in Winfield, Mary Dunlap\\'s sole errand was\\r\\nto read a telegram she found awaiting her, send another, and take the\\r\\nfirst train back West.On the fourth morning following, she opened her eyes in a beautiful\\r\\nroom in one of the elegant homes of a New York city suburb. It was\\r\\nstill early, and she lay quiet for a few minutes, feasting her\\r\\nbeauty-loving eyes on the evidences of abundant means and highly\\r\\ncultured taste spread lavishly about her. She had been too weary the\\r\\nnight before to take in any details, except a bed. Mrs. Dunlap was\\r\\naccustomed to the position of honored guest in all sorts of homes.\\r\\nShe could accommodate herself to the furnishings of the plainest home\\r\\nwith a grace that was one of her charms; but she confessed to her very\\r\\nintimate friends that when \"the lines fell to her in pleasant places,\"\\r\\nit always stirred an extra note of thanksgiving in her heart. There was\\r\\ncertainly nothing lacking here; nothing to offend the most fastidious\\r\\ntaste, or for the most exacting to desire.The days and nights just past had been strenuous ones to this always\\r\\nindustrious woman. There had been first the rapid journey involving\\r\\nanother failure in appointment, for this woman who prided herself\\r\\non never failing; an equally rapid return to the East, reaching her\\r\\nnext engagement just in time; then two hours by rail to her evening\\r\\nappointment; and here she was taking breath in a lovely room with a\\r\\nwhole day of rest before she had to start again!She was in no haste to move. Her thoughtful hostess had urged her not\\r\\nto hasten down in the morning. \"We do not breakfast until nine, and not\\r\\nalways then if the head of the house is absent; as he is now I am sorry\\r\\nto say. I have always wanted him to meet you. Dear Mrs. Dunlap, I may\\r\\nas well confess that I am awfully proud of my husband!\" The sentence\\r\\nhad closed with an apologetic laugh.What a transparent little lady her hostess was! She ought to be very\\r\\nhappy, with a husband of whom she was \"awfully\" proud, a beautiful home\\r\\ncrowded with all the luxuries that wealth could produce, and probably\\r\\nnot a care in the world!Mary Dunlap could not resist a little sigh of pity for herself; she\\r\\nwas a lonely woman. Her husband and home and child all gone from her.\\r\\nShe, too, had been \"proud\" of her husband with abundant reason; and her\\r\\nbeautiful girl. But her girl was safe. The terrors of this awful world\\r\\ncould not touch her.She thought of \"Daisy,\" and shuddered for the narrowness of her escape.\\r\\nHad she escaped? Would that wretch try to find her again? Perhaps she\\r\\nhad not done her whole duty. She ought to have warned the mother. What\\r\\nwere mothers about, to be so careless? But for that disabled engine,\\r\\nthe child would have gone straight on her dangerous way!Very slowly at last she went about the business of dressing, enjoying\\r\\nluxuries of the toilet not found ordinarily in hotels or boarding\\r\\nhouses, and reveling in costly trifles lavishly furnished. Even in the\\r\\nhalls she came upon treasures of art to study over, and as she lingered\\r\\nbefore them, she told herself with a half wistful smile that she must\\r\\nhave a care lest she become envious of Mrs. Oliver.Then she fell to moralizing. Was it probable that her hostess had her\\r\\nheart\\'s desire in all things? It looked so.There were two daughters, she had heard, who were their mother\\'s joy\\r\\nand pride also. Certainly the outward appearance of the home left\\r\\nnothing to wish for. In such an atmosphere it was hardly possible\\r\\nto avoid thinking of sharply contrasted lives. Not her own, though\\r\\nthe contrast there was marked enough. Still, she lived a busy and,\\r\\nshe believed, a useful life, and was happy in her work. But she knew\\r\\nwomen—many of them—to whom the word \"happy\" could not be applied; women\\r\\nwith warped, stunted, yes—wrecked lives!Instantly with that word, her thoughts flew again to \"Daisy,\" the\\r\\nacquaintance of a day, who had been so close to wreckage and who\\r\\nhad made a permanent place for herself in this mother-heart. That\\r\\nawful man! Would she ever meet him again? If so, what would happen!\\r\\nWhat if she should meet him under circumstances that would compel\\r\\nher acknowledgement of him as an acquaintance? For instance, what if\\r\\nhe should, after all, become Daisy\\'s husband! She recoiled from the\\r\\nthought as she might have done from a blow; yet one could not be sure;\\r\\nthe child had given herself unreservedly to him, unworthy of her as he\\r\\nseemed. Perhaps her love would redeem his life! Ought she not to hope\\r\\nso? Yet her very soul revolted from it!Next, she was in the lower hall looking over the morning mail,\\r\\ngathering from it letters and telegrams for herself; and her hostess\\r\\nwas coming forward to meet her, in the most charming of house gowns,\\r\\nwith a face as bright as the morning. She was voluble in her hope that\\r\\nthe night had been restful, and that her guest could give them the\\r\\nentire day.\"It is so delightful that Mr. Oliver is at home to enjoy you; I had\\r\\nno hope of such a thing. He came home unexpectedly on a later train\\r\\nthan yours. He had started on a very long business trip, expecting to\\r\\nbe gone for several months. Then, one of those unaccountable business\\r\\nchanges came up—I never pretend to understand business—and he came\\r\\nback. The children and I held a jubilee over his arrival. You can\\'t\\r\\nthink what a trial it is to have him away so much! Fully half his time\\r\\nis spent in the West, or the South, or somewhere!\"At that moment the dining-room door opened, and the voluble voice\\r\\nflowed on. \"Oh, Ralph, are you down already? Mrs. Dunlap, let me\\r\\npresent my husband, Mr. Oliver.\"And Mary Dunlap was face to face with the man she knew as \"R. H.\\r\\nKeller\"!How they got through with that awful breakfast hour Mrs. Dunlap was\\r\\nnever afterwards quite certain. She knew she had a sudden frightened\\r\\nfeeling that she must not wreck that poor woman\\'s home not yet, at\\r\\nleast. She must take time and think what to do. She must keep up some\\r\\nform of appearances; she must seem to receive the man as her host;\\r\\nshe must not say anything about the Kennard House or the interrupted\\r\\njourney, or the disabled engine. What could she say? She knew that she\\r\\ndid not address him, directly, and that his wife did more than her full\\r\\nshare of the talking, for which she mentally blessed her.Once the wife said: \"Why, Ralph, what on earth is the matter? You are\\r\\nas white as a ghost! Don\\'t you feel well? I don\\'t think you ought to\\r\\nstart again to-night; I don\\'t really.\"He put her off with a pleasantry of some sort; asked if the girls had\\r\\ngone to school already, and gave careful attention to serving the guest.Somehow the ordeal was lived through.As they arose from the table Mrs. Oliver issued her directions.\"Now, Ralph, I want you to take Mrs. Dunlap to the library and\\r\\nentertain her for the next half hour. I have a tiresome committee\\r\\nmeeting of the utmost importance that demands my personal attention;\\r\\nbut I am going to dismiss it in half an hour, and then we\\'ll make plans\\r\\nfor the day. It is delightful to be able to have you both for all day!\"There was no attempt on the part of either to reply. Silently the host\\r\\nthrew open the door of his well-equipped library, which under other\\r\\ncircumstances Mrs. Dunlap would have found pleasure in exploring, and\\r\\nsilently motioned her to a seat. While she sank among the cushions of\\r\\na luxurious chair, he carefully closed the door; then, crossing to the\\r\\ndoors leading to the music room, he closed them also. He seated himself\\r\\nbut a few feet from her and spoke in the tone he had used when he asked\\r\\nher why she had presumed to interfere with him.\"Well. I am at your mercy! What do you propose to do?\" That was what he\\r\\nsaid.She looked steadily at him, but was speechless.After waiting a moment he added: \"I did not interfere with what you\\r\\nsaw fit to do, by word or glance, although you must know that I could\\r\\nhave done so had I seen fit. Why you have been silent thus far and have\\r\\nchosen to accept my wife\\'s hospitality, I am at a loss to understand;\\r\\nunless it is in the interests of a still greater sensation. Is it your\\r\\nintention to tell me how you mean to proceed in the blasting of my\\r\\nhome, or do you still prefer to work in the dark?\"The man was actually arraigning her! Or was this merely a game of\\r\\nbluff? What kind of woman did he take her to be! The indignant blood\\r\\nsurged in her veins; she got out of the comfortable chair and took an\\r\\nuncompromising straight-backed one directly opposite his.\"Are you so accustomed to \\'working in the dark\\' that you fancy others\\r\\nare doing it also?\" she said, fixing him with her clear gaze. \"Did you\\r\\nsuppose that I had the slightest idea of meeting you when I came to\\r\\nthis house and accepted its hospitality?\"His face changed suddenly and he bent forward as if to lessen the\\r\\ndistance between them, speaking eagerly.\"Have I been mistaken in you? Mrs. Dunlap, on your honor as a woman,\\r\\ndid you not find out my name somewhere and follow me, to this house\\r\\nwith my discomfiture in view?\"\"I certainly did not!\" she answered indignantly. \"Do you think I would\\r\\nhave slept under your roof knowingly? I have not yet awakened from the\\r\\ndaze of horror into which the sight of you threw me.\"\"Then I beg your pardon,\" he said with evident relief. \"I have wronged\\r\\nyou. Now I will literally and gratefully, if you will permit the word,\\r\\nthrow myself on your mercy. You see what my home is, and my family I\\r\\nhave children. You have been given some idea of what they think of me,\\r\\nand what I am in the main; an attentive husband and father, doing his\\r\\nutmost for the comfort of his home. You happen to have seen me under\\r\\ndamning conditions, and without understanding the—the temptations. And\\r\\nnow you have it in your power to ruin this home and blast the future\\r\\nof young and trusting lives; as well as break a woman\\'s heart! Or,\\r\\nyou have it in your power to save us all! You are a merciful woman, a\\r\\nphilanthropist, my wife tells me, I believe you will save us. You see I\\r\\nam not asking justice, but pleading for mercy.\"He had not moved her by a hair\\'s breadth unless it were to increase her\\r\\nindignation. Her voice was steady and cold.\"Did you not have it in your power to ruin two homes, one of them\\r\\nwidowed and fatherless, and did you spare them? You dare to talk to me\\r\\nof \\'mercy\\' and \\'philanthropy\\' when you were not willing to shelter even\\r\\nyour own fireside!\"He dropped his eyes from her face and worked nervously with the paper\\r\\ncutter he held.\"You do not understand,\" he said. \"It will be difficult to make you\\r\\nunderstand! You are one who makes no allowance for a man\\'s temptations.\"She flashed a look of scorn at him, but he did not look at her, and\\r\\nwent on more quickly.\"I don\\'t know what devil possessed me to do as I did that night. I did\\r\\nnot plan it, deliberately. I did not plan any of it, it just happened.\\r\\nA fellow, whom we called \\'the parson\\' in college, because he always\\r\\ntook those parts in the plays, had just written me about a mock wedding\\r\\nat which he had officiated, and he was within easy reach. The truth is\\r\\nthe girl tempted me!\"He caught the flash in her eyes just then, and heard and understood her\\r\\nwords:\"Oh, of course; \\'The woman beguiled me\\'!\"He pulled himself together. \"I simply mean that she was—was—very\\r\\nbewildering, and I—\" He was finding it hard to explain. He wished that\\r\\nthe woman would look at the floor; or at something, instead of at him!\"I am going to be entirely frank with you,\" he said at last, with a\\r\\nsudden assumption of friendliness. \"My wife is—we are—not congenial,\\r\\nnot well mated; our marriage was a sort of mockery, from the first, one\\r\\nof convenience, one may say, on my part. I thought I ought to marry her\\r\\nbecause she cared for me, and because well, for family reasons. I never\\r\\nreally loved with my whole soul any woman until I met Daisy; after I\\r\\nknew her, what seemed really wrong to me, was to continue the travesty\\r\\nof home life when I knew that home, to me, meant her. I intended, I\\r\\nfully intended, as soon as the necessary preliminaries could be managed\\r\\nto set myself free, in order to possess her.\"But I did not plan to injure her reputation in any way, nor indeed\\r\\nanyone\\'s reputation. Divorces are common enough I am sure. The idea\\r\\nof running away with Daisy for a few weeks came upon me, as I said,\\r\\nsuddenly. I was going West, very far West, and she was returning home,\\r\\nwhen I met her on the train. It was impossible for me not to see how\\r\\neasily we could enjoy a delightful season together, at some pleasant\\r\\nresort where neither of us was known—merely as good friends you\\r\\nunderstand. The marriage ceremony was to be a temporary convenience to\\r\\nquiet her nervousness, to be explained afterwards as a good joke. On my\\r\\nhonor I meant nothing else.\"He came to a sudden pause, for Mary Dunlap had risen, her face white\\r\\nwith righteous indignation.\"I must interrupt you,\" she said. \"I fail to see why you should\\r\\ndisgrace yourself and me by exposing such details, or attempting to\\r\\ngloss over your sin. If you think to win sympathy thereby, you must\\r\\nhave a strange idea of women! You to defile that sacred word \\'love\\'\\r\\nin such connection! Why even a wild beast knows that love means\\r\\nprotection, means sacrifice of self for the sake of the object loved!\\r\\nBut you loved this child only enough to practice upon her the most\\r\\ncruel deception a man can offer to a woman, to blight her future, and\\r\\nbring despair to her family, for the sake of gratifying for a few\\r\\nweeks, your passion for her society!\"It is folly to suppose that you did not know what you were doing! You\\r\\nare neither a fool, nor a lunatic. Why do you want to grovel before me\\r\\nby exposing that whole vile plot? It seems amazing that you can have\\r\\nso soon forgotten what you said to me that night at the hotel; and\\r\\nhow awfully your words and your position contradict those statements!\\r\\nBefore I saw you in this house this morning, as the husband of another\\r\\nwoman, I supposed you were a half-way decent villain, who had tried to\\r\\nrun away with and marry the girl he fancied he loved.\"He too had risen. He trembled visibly and he was white to his lips, but\\r\\nhe tried to speak with dignity.\"I have made a mistake,\" he said. \"I see I cannot make you understand.\\r\\nBut I am ready to grovel still, and beg your mercy. I have not ruined\\r\\nher; she is free from me forever; and I am asking you to have pity on\\r\\nmy wife and children. And since no harm can come to anyone by your\\r\\nsilence, to spare my family. I am ready to give you my word of honor\\r\\nthat I will never see the girl again, never attempt to communicate with\\r\\nher in any way.\"Mrs. Dunlap\\'s immediate response to this, brought a scarlet flush over\\r\\nhis face and set the blood humming in his ears: \"Your word of honor!\"But he was in real terror now; he had neither cowed nor deceived\\r\\nthis woman. No sentimental twaddle about uncongenial marriages and\\r\\nsoul-love, had done other than deepen her disgust.He was also realizing something of the power that such a woman would\\r\\nhave, once she exerted it, against him; and she was his wife\\'s friend!\\r\\nYet he had an instinct that he could trust her. He must beg.\"I deserve that,\" he said, after a breathless moment. \"Well then, I\\r\\nwill swear by all that you hold sacred never to see or try to hear from\\r\\nthat girl again. Will you keep my secret?\"For a full minute, which must have seemed an hour to the waiting man,\\r\\nthere was silence in that room. Then Mary Dunlap spoke.\"With conditions, yes; but you must do more than that. There are\\r\\nother girls in the world. I do not ask you to give me your pledged\\r\\nword because—\" There was a single expressive gesture of her hand that\\r\\nconsigned any \"pledged\" word of his to the lowest level of contempt,\\r\\nand she left it to complete the sentence.\"But you have chosen to speak of me as a philanthropist. Perhaps you\\r\\nare aware that my life is given to the protection of young innocent\\r\\ngirls who are in danger because of such men as you; and you may\\r\\npossibly understand what mighty forces I can call to my aid anywhere\\r\\nin the civilized world, if occasion requires. In view of this, for the\\r\\nsake of your wife and daughters, so long as you keep your life steadily\\r\\nwithin the law that governs respectable men, and hold yourself from\\r\\ninsulting, by your attentions, not only the girl you tried to ruin, but\\r\\nevery other girl and woman on God\\'s earth, I will agree to keep silence\\r\\nto all but the one whose affections you have stolen, and her mother!\\r\\nThese two shall know all that I do; the girl, that she may learn to\\r\\nturn from the thought of you with loathing, and the mother that she may\\r\\nguard her child with jealous care from men like you.\"Then, I must remind you that the same forces for righteousness that\\r\\nstand ready to help me, are as able to keep me informed as to how\\r\\nsteadily you adhere to the terms I have made. On these grounds do you\\r\\nwish mercy from me?\"The man was looking steadily at her now. Man of the world as he was,\\r\\nhypocrite as the life he lived had trained him to be, accustomed to\\r\\nsneering at women, to flirting with women, to boasting within himself\\r\\nthat he could lead them captive at his will, he looked at this woman\\r\\nwhose hair was silvering, and felt that she could, and would, keep her\\r\\nword! For a long minute, he gazed at her, as one compelled to consider\\r\\nher, then bowed silently, and dropped his gaze to the floor.There were quick steps in the hall, an eager hand on the door-knob, and\\r\\nMrs. Oliver fluttered in.\"It was a long half hour, wasn\\'t it?\" she began. \"Those women would\\r\\ntalk! I thought I should never get away from them. Goodness! What is\\r\\nthe matter with you two? You look as though you were posing for high\\r\\ntragedy. You haven\\'t quarreled, have you?\"Mary Dunlap arose to the occasion.\"My dear Mrs. Oliver, I have decided that I shall have to change my\\r\\nplans, and start for Albany by the noon train to-day. There is a matter\\r\\nI have concluded must have my immediate attention.\"Mrs. Oliver was voluble with regrets. Such a disappointment! She\\r\\nhad been planning for this one day for so long! And Mr. Oliver was\\r\\nunexpectedly here to enjoy it with them! So sorry especially to have\\r\\nher miss seeing their new Y. W. building that had been planned \"in\\r\\nexact accordance with your own ideas, dear Mrs. Dunlap, and it is\\r\\nsimply perfect. Do, Ralph, tell her how sorry you are not to be able to\\r\\nshow her through it.\"Thus urged, Mr. Oliver succeeded in finding voice to say: \"Mrs. Dunlap\\r\\nunderstands, I am sure, better than I could tell her, how ready I am to\\r\\ndo her bidding.\"Mrs. Dunlap got away by the noon train and took the night-express\\r\\nfor the West, canceling all her engagements for the week; she had\\r\\nmore important work to look after. Not telegrams, nor long distance\\r\\ntelephones, nor even carefully written letters could serve her now. She\\r\\nmust go in person to try to explain, as best she might, to that dear\\r\\ngirl who was waiting at home to hear from one to whom she had given her\\r\\ntrust, to prove him to her mother as \"good and noble!\"As she sped westward that afternoon the good woman prayed that she\\r\\nmight be able to help save that sweet, periled life.MRS. SHELDON and her daughter Daisy were occupying easy chairs in their\\r\\npleasant living-room, surrounded by all possible evidences of home\\r\\ncomforts, and luxuries. But even a passing glance at the two faces\\r\\nwould have suggested unrest. The mother\\'s face looked worn, and her\\r\\neyes were anxious; while the daughter\\'s eyes were tense with excitement.\"Daisy dear,\" began Mrs. Sheldon, and was interrupted:\"Please, Mother, won\\'t you call me \\'Marguerite\\'?\"A look of pain flushed the mother\\'s face but she spoke quietly.\"Why, daughter, you know I nearly always say \\'Daisy.\\'\"\"I know you do; but I—I don\\'t like it to-night; I—Mother, I just can\\'t\\r\\nbear the sound of it! That\\'s the only explanation I can give.\"Unshed tears were in the mother\\'s eyes. \"I will try to remember,\" she\\r\\nsaid, her voice low and tremulous. \"But you are my \\'Daisy\\' you know;\\r\\nall I have left in this world; and your father loved that name.\"Daisy with a sudden movement flung herself on the arm of the great easy\\r\\nchair and hid her face in her mother\\'s neck; when she tried to talk her\\r\\nvoice choked with sobs.\"Oh, Mother, do please try to understand; you know what Father was to\\r\\nme, and you surely know that I love you with all my soul. If I hadn\\'t,\\r\\nI—\"But the convulsive sobs came again, and she once more hid her face,\\r\\nwhile the mother\\'s arms clasped her tenderly. A few minutes passed,\\r\\nthen the girl sat erect and tried again.\"Mother dear, forgive me.\" As she spoke, she slipped to the footstool\\r\\nbeside her mother\\'s chair. \"I didn\\'t mean to worry you. I don\\'t often\\r\\ngo to pieces in this way, do I? But—you can\\'t understand what I am\\r\\ngoing through! It seems so strange not to hear a word after almost five\\r\\ndays! I thought I should certainly get a telegram, at least! Mamma, I\\r\\ndidn\\'t mean that about my name; at least not in the way it must have\\r\\nsounded. I shall get over that feeling, of course; but you see he did\\r\\nnot know me by any other name; and when you used it, for a second it\\r\\nalmost seemed as though I could hear his voice, and oh, Mother, I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t bear it! I spoke right out, before I thought.\"Mother, it seems as though you must understand what I mean! Don\\'t you\\r\\nknow you told me about how you loved Father so very much even right at\\r\\nthe first? That is the way I feel about Rufus. Mother, I love him with\\r\\nall my soul, and I always shall! I never before knew what love meant,\\r\\nthat kind of love, I mean and I can\\'t tell you how it almost kills me\\r\\nto think that you don\\'t believe in him!\"But you know you have hardly seen him. You have just let yourself be\\r\\nprejudiced by those horrid women who gossiped about him; just because\\r\\nhe, was polite and helpful to those little flappers who were traveling\\r\\nalone; he showed them the same attention that any gentleman would. But\\r\\nI don\\'t blame you, Mother dear; I suppose it is natural for mothers to\\r\\nfeel so; when you never have had a chance to find out for yourself what\\r\\na wonderful man he is. Besides, think how I helped it along!\"Why, mother, when I think of the way I let that awful Mrs. Dunlap, a\\r\\nperfect stranger, manage me so that I almost insulted him, it makes me\\r\\nfeel as though I were going insane! Oh, I hope I shall never see or\\r\\nhear of her again! How could I let her make me treat him so! I don\\'t\\r\\nsee how he can ever forgive me! O, Mother! How can I live any longer! I\\r\\nwish I could die to-night!\"It was just then that the sound of the door bell pealed through the\\r\\nquiet house. The sound had instant effect on the nerves of the half\\r\\ninsane girl. She sprang up quickly, evidently making a supreme effort\\r\\nat self-control, and spoke in a more natural tone.\"I\\'m afraid that\\'s Nelson! I entirely forgot that he was to come\\r\\nto-night if he got back in time, to tell me how the vote went; as if I\\r\\ncared how they voted!\"With this last word, her voice had returned to bitter sarcasm; but\\r\\nafter a moment she continued more quietly.\"Will you see him, Mother, and tell him tell him anything you like?\\r\\nI simply cannot talk with him to-night; nor with anybody else. Oh,\\r\\nMother, kiss me and let me run away!\"By this time the poor mother had no words to offer about anything.\\r\\nShe put her arms around her daughter, kissed her tenderly and opened\\r\\nthe door for her to escape by way of the back hall, just as the maid\\r\\nappeared at the sitting-room doorway, card tray in hand.\"For Miss Daisy, ma\\'am. Has she gone upstairs? Shall I take it up to\\r\\nher room?\"\"No,\" said the weary, faithful mother. \"Daisy does not feel able to see\\r\\ncallers to-night; I\\'ll attend to it.\"She held out her hand for the card and read on it:\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. J. C. Dunlap, Albany.\"\\n\\n\"Dunlap!\" Over that name the face of the mother flushed, then paled.That was the name of the woman who had watched over her darling with\\r\\nsuch wise and patient care, and brought her safely home! Could it\\r\\npossibly be the same woman who was waiting in the parlor! If so, how\\r\\ncould she talk with her just now? She felt completely exhausted. Still,\\r\\nDaisy certainly must not be called. She reminded herself that the name\\r\\nDunlap was common enough, even though she did not happen to recall it\\r\\namong her acquaintances. It really was not at all probable that a woman\\r\\nwho lived hundreds of miles away should suddenly appear late in the\\r\\nevening to make a call!At last she crossed the hall and opened the living-room door. One\\r\\nglance sufficed; the woman who arose at her entrance was the same one\\r\\nwho had kissed Daisy goodbye with unmistakable tenderness only a few\\r\\ndays before!\"I\\'m afraid I have startled you,\" said Mary Dunlap moving forward; for\\r\\nDaisy\\'s mother had paused suddenly the moment she caught sight of her\\r\\ncaller, and her pale face was expressive of pain. \"Of course you did\\r\\nnot expect to see me so soon again, but I—it became my duty to return\\r\\nWest sooner than I had planned. I hope I may see your daughter for a\\r\\nfew minutes? There is a—I have heard of—something connected with our\\r\\njourney together, that she, perhaps, ought to be told.\"It was a very hesitating sentence; the speaker\\'s tone and manner\\r\\nsuggested embarrassing uncertainty as to just what she should do next.\\r\\nSomething helped the mother to self-control and decision. Whatever that\\r\\nwoman thought she ought to tell Daisy ought to be told! She believed in\\r\\nher! She might be mistaken in judgment, of course; unduly alarmed about\\r\\na small matter; all people were liable to mistakes, occasionally. But\\r\\nshe was sincere! Of that, Mrs. Sheldon felt absolutely sure; and what\\r\\nshe had to say might help to clear away some anxieties. She held out\\r\\nher hand and spoke cordially.\"I am glad to see you again, Mrs. Dunlap, but I am afraid that my\\r\\ndaughter will not be able to do so, this evening; she has had a\\r\\nsomewhat trying day and is feeling to-night as though she could not\\r\\ntalk with anybody. She seems nervously unstrung with her recent\\r\\nexperiences. She has retired, I think, but perhaps you will trust me\\r\\nwith a message?\"Mrs. Dunlap reached a quick decision. \"Perhaps I had better tell you\\r\\nall about it,\" she said, speaking as an intimate friend might have\\r\\ndone. \"I have taken a room at the Delport House, and shall not leave\\r\\nuntil sometime to-morrow afternoon I think. If Daisy is feeling better,\\r\\nI could see her in the morning. I hope you will pardon my interest in\\r\\nyour daughter and my familiar use of her name. She and I grew quite\\r\\nintimate during that one day you know.\"The mother\\'s quick thought was, \"What would she think if she knew that\\r\\nI had just been told to say \\'Marguerite!\\'\"Mary Dunlap, noting the troubled glance of the mother hurried on:\"I had a precious little girl of my own, once, about your daughter\\'s\\r\\nage, Mrs. Sheldon. She was my only child. That night when your daughter\\r\\nstayed with me in my room was the first time I had ever been able to\\r\\nsay with my whole heart, \\'Thank God my Margaret is forever safe in the\\r\\nEverlasting arms!\\'\"That is my apology for intruding on you again. And now, perhaps it\\r\\nwould be wiser for me to have my talk with you, leaving you to repeat\\r\\nas much or as little as you see fit, to your daughter.\"Mrs. Sheldon answered quickly, excitedly: \"Oh, I wish you would!\" she\\r\\nsaid, \"I have so longed to see you and ask you a lot of questions.\\r\\nWon\\'t you sit down? And please, tell me first, about that night at the\\r\\nhotel. I know so very little about it, and I want to understand exactly\\r\\nwhat happened. Daisy is very vague in her story, and is so excitable\\r\\nthat I dare not question her in her present state. All that I now know\\r\\npositively is that because of crowded conditions at the hotel, you\\r\\nkindly permitted her to share your room for the night.\"\"Is it possible that you have not been told the whole story!\" exclaimed\\r\\nMary Dunlap in amazement. It seemed incredible that such a girl as the\\r\\none she had protected had kept her mother in ignorance of the whole of\\r\\nthat night\\'s happenings.\"Oh, tell me quickly!\" said the mother, with instant premonition,\\r\\ndropping down on the edge of the couch where the caller had seated\\r\\nherself. \"Tell me all, please. I have been utterly at a loss to\\r\\nunderstand Daisy\\'s unstrung state of mind.\"Mary Dunlap wondered wildly where she should begin and then plunged\\r\\ninto her subject.\"First, may I ask, please, about this Mr. Keller whom I met that night\\r\\nwith your daughter? Of course I knew nothing of him whatever. Is he a\\r\\npersonal acquaintance of yours? A—friend?\"There was an instant flash of indignation in the mother\\'s eyes.\"Certainly not!\" she replied with almost haughtiness in her voice. \"I\\r\\nhave met him but once and I have never liked anything that I have heard\\r\\nabout him. He is a sort of a traveling agent I believe for some New\\r\\nYork firm, and business seems to call him to this particular town more\\r\\nfrequently than I could wish. My daughter thinks that I am prejudiced\\r\\nagainst him because of certain stories we have heard about him, which\\r\\nshe thinks have no foundation except in malicious gossip. But frankly,\\r\\nhe is a source of much anxiety to me.\"For the past few months he has been quite attentive to Daisy, that\\r\\nis, as attentive as circumstances would allow, and I—do not trust him.\\r\\nI do not know why. But I don\\'t! I am utterly at a loss to account for\\r\\nthe influence he seems to have acquired over her in the few brief\\r\\nmeetings they have had. She thinks me hard and cruel because I well, I\\r\\ncan scarcely bear the sound of his name! And yet I have to confess that\\r\\nI have no good reason to offer for such a feeling. It appears that he\\r\\nreally asked her to marry him. The idea is so obnoxious to me that I\\r\\ncan scarcely bear to utter the words!\"\"And this trip they were taking together,\" ventured the troubled\\r\\nquestioner; \"you knew about it of course?\"\"Trip!\" exclaimed the mother indignantly. \"They were not traveling\\r\\ntogether! Why, I sent her away on this visit to get her out of his\\r\\nvicinity because I heard that he was intending to remain in this\\r\\ntown several weeks! They simply met on the train. Daisy thinks it\\r\\nwas a coincidence I suppose from what she says, but of course, he\\r\\nfollowed her. I am positive of that. To put it plainly, he seems to\\r\\nbe infatuated with her. And she, poor child, has admitted to me this\\r\\nvery afternoon that she loves him with all her heart! Oh, it seems so\\r\\nterrible for me to be telling this to you, a stranger, burdening you\\r\\nwith my anxiety.\"Mrs. Sheldon wiped the tears away from her eyes, and struggled to keep\\r\\nmore from falling. \"But you have been so kind to me and to Daisy, and\\r\\nthere has been no one to whom I could go for advice.\"Mary Dunlap slipped an arm around the shoulders of the mother with\\r\\nstrong reassurance.\"My dear!\" she said in her warm comforting strong voice, \"Just you cry\\r\\nif you want to, and don\\'t worry about telling me. I\\'m used to helping\\r\\nmothers and girls. It is my job in life. And don\\'t you worry. I\\'m going\\r\\nto help you, and I thank God I can. I\\'m glad too that you have told me\\r\\nthis, for now I can speak frankly and tell you all I know. It is going\\r\\nto make things a lot easier to set right. And now, I\\'ve got to tell you\\r\\nthe whole story.\"THE voice was low and tender in which she began her story of the\\r\\nafternoon on the train. She made it plain that she had been so busy\\r\\nwith her writing that she scarcely noticed who got on the train until\\r\\ntoward evening when her work was done. She had been barely conscious of\\r\\nthe two who took the seat in front of her, had given them but a swift\\r\\nglance and decided that they were bride and groom; until her work was\\r\\ndone and she had leisure to look around. And then almost at once she\\r\\nwas fascinated by the lovely face of the girl in front of her.Mary Dunlap was quick to note the pleased relaxing of the troubled face\\r\\nas she said this, and the instant sympathy as she gave her own first\\r\\nimpression of the man who was sitting beside the girl.But as the tale progressed showing how late the train was, with\\r\\ninevitable missed connections, the mother\\'s eye kindled with gratitude.\"Oh!\" she interrupted, \"I\\'m so glad you were there! What would Daisy\\r\\nhave done if you had not been. She is so unused to traveling alone!\"Mary Dunlap went on to tell of the apparent argument between the two\\r\\nin front of her, the discomfort on the face of the girl, and her own\\r\\ncontinued wonder that such a girl should apparently be married to a\\r\\nman so much older, and of such a type. The mother gave a little gasp\\r\\nof dismay as she realized that this fine Christian woman had actually\\r\\nthought her daughter was married to that man! But it was only the\\r\\ndismay she had felt before at the horrible thought of him, and the old\\r\\nresentment at the idea of his presuming to be intimate with her girl.Not until the story progressed to the point where Mrs. Dunlap stood\\r\\nbefore the hotel desk writing her own name in the registry and noted\\r\\nthe names on the line just above her own, \"R. H. Keller and wife,\" did\\r\\nthe mother grasp the full meaning of it all. Then she leaned forward\\r\\nwith a quick little motion and caught at both the firm capable hands of\\r\\nher visitor, crying:\"Oh, Mrs. Dunlap! You don\\'t mean it! You can\\'t mean that he dared do a\\r\\nthing like that! The wretch! The—the—beast!\"Her eyes were full of tears again. She could not seem to be able to get\\r\\nwords strong enough to express her horror and disgust.\"But of course my Daisy didn\\'t know that!\" she said lifting up her head\\r\\nwith a gleam of hope, though there was a sob in the end of her voice.\"Not until I told her, some time afterwards,\" said Mary Dunlap.\"You told her! She knows! And yet she could tell me to-day that she\\r\\nloves him! Oh! What shall I do?\"\"Wait, dear Mrs. Sheldon,\" said Mrs. Dunlap putting a detaining hand on\\r\\nthe drooping shoulder. \"Love is a strange thing. It throws illusions\\r\\nover the object that turn it into something entirely different. You\\r\\nmust remember that. Don\\'t blame Daisy too much. She explained to me at\\r\\nonce after her first startled look, that of course he had done that to\\r\\nprotect her reputation, since they had been delayed and all their plans\\r\\nupset. She said that they had expected to reach San Fergus at midnight,\\r\\nand that a minister friend of Mr. Keller\\'s was to have met the train\\r\\nand performed the marriage ceremony. She said that Mr. Keller had\\r\\ntelegraphed ahead for the bridal suite to be reserved for them in the\\r\\nSan Fergus hotel.\"\"My Daisy told you that!\"It was years before Mrs. Dunlap forgot the tone, and the look on that\\r\\nmother\\'s face when she said those words. It was as if some one had\\r\\nsuddenly taken from her everything that was worth while in life, as if\\r\\nshe felt that all the years of tender rearing, and care of precious\\r\\nlove and companionship between her and her child were suddenly wiped\\r\\nout in one great awful act of disloyalty and broken faith with her\\r\\nmother. Oh, there would be a reaction by and by when the mother would\\r\\nexcuse, and forgive, and bleed over her darling; but this first blow\\r\\nwas like the very severing of the life bond between them, and it was\\r\\nterrible to witness.Mary Dunlap felt that it was a pity that the girl had not had to suffer\\r\\nthat look herself with full understanding of all that it meant to her\\r\\nwonderful little mother.\"My dear! I feel like a surgeon performing an operation, but you must\\r\\nknow it all,\" said Mary Dunlap tenderly.\"Oh, yes, yes,\" breathed the mother sorrowfully. \"If there is more, go\\r\\non. It seems as if nothing mattered if Daisy, my Daisy, would go to\\r\\nsuch lengths. Actually running away to get married!\"\"My dear friend, you must remember that she thinks she is very much in\\r\\nlove, and that she feels that you have been deceived about her loved\\r\\none. They were planning to send you a telegram immediately as soon\\r\\nas the ceremony was performed, and were counting confidently on your\\r\\nimmediate change of feeling so soon as the inevitable step was taken.\\r\\nYou must remember also that your daughter was greatly troubled even\\r\\nthen, at the momentary deception.\"As the time drew near, and the delay became inevitable, she began\\r\\nto see the whole thing in more nearly its true light, and it caused\\r\\nher deep distress. So much so that when Mr. Keller left her for a few\\r\\nmoments in the hotel parlor where we both were waiting for our rooms\\r\\nto be prepared, she utterly forgot my presence, and began walking up\\r\\nand down the room, and actually giving a little moan of distress. It\\r\\nwas then that I dared to interfere and offer my sympathy and any help I\\r\\ncould give.\"\"Oh, how can I ever thank you! How can I thank God enough for having\\r\\nsent you there!\" moaned the stricken mother.\"I think He did plan that I should be there,\" said Mary Dunlap\\r\\nreverently. \"I was scheduled to be far from there at that time, had\\r\\nimportant speaking engagements to fill, and could not understand why\\r\\nall my plans were frustrated, but it seems that the Father had need\\r\\nof a servant right there, and perhaps this was more important than\\r\\nany meeting I could have addressed. I began to feel so as soon as\\r\\nyour Daisy turned to me so readily, so even eagerly, like the little\\r\\nflower-faced child that she is.\"I had no difficulty in getting her to tell me her trouble. She trusted\\r\\nme at once, and when I offered my room as a refuge for the night she\\r\\naccepted most eagerly. Even when I told her how she was booked in the\\r\\nregistry, she did not turn from me, as I feared she might. Instead she\\r\\nseemed aghast for a moment; then her loyalty to her lover made her at\\r\\nonce attempt to excuse him. However, that did not prevent her from\\r\\nbegging me to take her to the room immediately, before he returned from\\r\\nhis telegraphing. She seemed to actually fear his influence upon her\\r\\nand to know that her only safe course was to go while he was gone.\"\"Oh, my poor child!\" moaned the mother.\"She made it very plain that Mr. Keller had overpersuaded her to\\r\\nthis marriage, and that while she could not bear to refuse him, she\\r\\nyet longed to wait until your consent could be obtained. Of course I\\r\\nadvised her strongly that this was the only possible right course, and\\r\\nshe seemed to agree with me.\"\"Yes, Daisy is very conscientious that is she was, before this came.\\r\\nBut she seems to be infatuated with that man! She has at this moment\\r\\nmore faith in him than in anyone else, I believe.\"\"Well, she was glad to get to my room then, at least,\" said the other\\r\\nwoman. \"She even wanted the door locked, and when I started to go down\\r\\nand tell Mr. Keller that she was safe and comfortable for the night\\r\\nwith a woman, she begged me to lock the door and take the key with me!\"\"And yet she can say she loves him, when she cannot trust him! And at\\r\\nsuch a time! Oh, my little girl!\"\"Dear friend, the human heart is a curious thing, and the devil has\\r\\nmany illusions wherewith to deceive, you know.\"\"And did you actually go down and talk to that man? What a wonderful\\r\\nheaven-sent friend you proved to be!\"\"I did. I\\'m afraid I rather enjoyed the commission. You must remember I\\r\\nhad been watching him in the train for several hours, and while he was\\r\\nmost courteous and assiduous in caring for her, and did nothing that I\\r\\ncould really put my finger on with which to find fault, I had acquired\\r\\nthe same feeling toward him that you seem to have. I just could not see\\r\\nhow that little flower of a girl could have married him. And of course\\r\\nwhen I talked with your daughter, finding out they were not married\\r\\nafter having seen how he registered, my feelings were anything but\\r\\nlenient toward him.\"\"I should think so! But oh, my little girl! What would her father have\\r\\nsaid if he could have known she was to pass through a thing like this!\"\"Courage, dear sister. I am sure God means something lovely to come out\\r\\nof all this.\"\"How could that possibly be!\" moaned the mother, \"Oh, if she could have\\r\\nbeen spared any contact with a creature like that! It is so terrible to\\r\\nsee her pass through such an experience. My little Daisy!\"\"Yes, but Mrs. Sheldon, think, if she did not have you in this trying\\r\\ntime!\"Suddenly there occurred an interruption. The two women became aware\\r\\nthat the maid had answered a ring at the door, and had let in someone\\r\\nwho was standing in the doorway of the room where they were sitting.Mrs. Sheldon got up quickly, with a hasty dab at her wet eyelashes and\\r\\nwent toward him.Mary Dunlap looked up to see a tall young man standing in the doorway\\r\\nwith his hat in his hand, a grave questioning look upon his face. He\\r\\nhad keen gray eyes, a crop of nicely groomed reddish curls, and he\\r\\nlooked strong and young and dependable.\"Oh, Nelson!\" exclaimed Mrs. Sheldon, a kind of dazed relief in her\\r\\nvoice, \"You came to see Daisy about that committee meeting, didn\\'t you?\\r\\nWhy—she—she wasn\\'t feeling very well to-night, Nelson. She has retired.\\r\\nShe had a headache. She asked me to excuse her.\"The grave eyes took on a look of anxiety.\"Daisy not well?\" he said as if that were an unheard of thing.\"I should have telephoned you not to come,\" apologized Mrs. Sheldon,\\r\\n\"but this friend of hers—this friend of mine—arrived just then, from\\r\\nout of town, and it slipped my mind. Let me introduce you to Mrs.\\r\\nDunlap, Nelson. Mrs. Dunlap, Mr. Whitney.\"\"A friend of Daisy\\'s?\" said the young man his grave eyes lighting\\r\\npleasantly, and he stepped forward and grasped Mrs. Dunlap\\'s hand,\\r\\ngiving her a swift searching glance.\"I certainly am!\" said Mary Dunlap with a hearty handclasp.He lingered only a minute or two to leave a message for the daughter\\r\\nabout what had happened at the committee meeting, but he gave another\\r\\nkeen parting glance accompanied by a warming smile as he left, that\\r\\nmade the stranger feel that he approved of her, and that he understood\\r\\nthat she was in no wise the cause of the tears that he had seen on\\r\\nDaisy\\'s mother\\'s face.After he was gone, Mrs. Sheldon came back to her caller.\"Why couldn\\'t it have been that young man?\" asked Mary Dunlap with a\\r\\nsigh!\"Oh, if it only could have been!\" sighed the mother. \"He is the dearest\\r\\nboy! My husband trusted him so. He has been Daisy\\'s schoolmate and\\r\\ncompanion for years, and yet she could think she has fallen in love\\r\\nwith that other creature!\"\"There, there, dear friend. I tell you the human heart is a mystery.\\r\\nAnd a girl at Daisy\\'s age gets queer ideas sometimes. She will come out\\r\\nof it and be fine and beautiful. You see!\"\"Oh! I don\\'t know!\" sighed the mother. \"She is so strange! Not even\\r\\nwilling to see Nelson. She thought it was Nelson when you came, and\\r\\nrushed away telling me she would not see him nor anyone else to-night!\\r\\nI could not tell him that of course. He has been so kind and so\\r\\ndevoted. And I can see that he is terribly worried about this Keller.\\r\\nHe looks as if he would like to fight every time Daisy mentions his\\r\\nname. But tell me, what did the fellow do when you told him Daisy was\\r\\ngoing to remain with you for the night?\"\"Do? He was fairly insolent. He was furious. He told me to mind my\\r\\nown business. He strode around that parlor like a madman, till I told\\r\\nhim Daisy had appealed to me for protection, and had told me she was\\r\\nnot yet married to him; but that I had seen how he registered in the\\r\\nhotel. Then he calmed down a little and began to try to smooth things\\r\\nover. He tried to explain that he had done that merely to protect the\\r\\ngirl, and that he intended to make everything right for her. He even\\r\\ncame to the point, before we were done, of saying that perhaps he had\\r\\nbeen wrong in doing it, but he had followed an impulse when he wrote.\\r\\nOh, you know how a man like that could lie himself out of anything! He\\r\\neven said that of course if Daisy preferred to be with me, it was all\\r\\nright, but he really must see her before she slept and arrange about\\r\\nhis telegrams. Of course I saw through that. He knew his influence over\\r\\nher!\"So I told him she had asked not to be disturbed, and that she did not\\r\\nwish to see him again until she was at home with her mother and her\\r\\nmother knew all. Then he began to rave at me of course but I let him\\r\\nunderstand that I should not hesitate to call for assistance if he\\r\\nmade further trouble, and I fancy he did not care for publicity, so he\\r\\nwithdrew with what grace he could.\"\"And then?\"\"Well, strange to say we had no further trouble with him. I had looked\\r\\nup trains and found there was a very early one. Perhaps he was asleep,\\r\\nalthough I was taking no chances. I decided to stay by till I placed\\r\\nher safely in her mother\\'s care.\"\"You have been wonderful!\" said the mother. \"I can never thank you.\\r\\nAnd I\\'m glad too, that you came and told me all to-night. It has been\\r\\nvery hard to hear, but it was right that I should know. Only, my dear\\r\\nnew strong friend, I don\\'t know what I am going to do. I am terrified\\r\\nat what may yet develop. I am sure that man will not be easily shaken\\r\\noff. He is probably only waiting till Daisy gets all strained up with\\r\\nanxiety, as she is now, when he knows she will be wax in his hands. I\\r\\ncannot believe he will give up so easily. He will know that you cannot\\r\\nlinger around to protect always, and unfortunately, he is not afraid of\\r\\nme.\"\"My dear, wait until you have heard the rest of the story.\"\"Oh, is there more?\" The mother\\'s face showed a new terror.She sat up tense and anxious clasping her frail hands in one another\\r\\ntill the knuckles showed white.\"No, dear Mrs. Sheldon, don\\'t be frightened,\" went on Mary Dunlap. \"I\\r\\nwill try to be as brief as possible, but I am sure you should know\\r\\neverything.\"\"Oh, yes!\" implored the white lipped mother.Mary Dunlap\\'s heart ached for her as she went on with the story:\"After I left Daisy with you that morning I went directly to New York\\r\\nwhere I was to be entertained by a Mrs. Oliver whom I had met a number\\r\\nof times in connection with my public work. She had often invited me to\\r\\nbe her guest and talk over various matters with her, but I had never\\r\\nbeen able to arrange a definite date before. I arrived at midnight, and\\r\\nwas taken almost at once to my room, seeing none of the family that\\r\\nnight except my hostess.\"But the next morning at breakfast I was introduced to her two lovely\\r\\ndaughters, and a moment later to her husband who had arrived a few\\r\\nmoments before on an early train from the West. Perhaps you can imagine\\r\\nmy horror when I looked up to greet him, and found that the man to whom\\r\\nMrs. Oliver was introducing me, calling him \\'her husband Mr. Oliver,\\'\\r\\nwas the Mr. Keller from whom your daughter had been rescued a few\\r\\nnights before!\"Mary Dunlap had told the end of her story rapidly, conscious that her\\r\\nlistener was under a heavy strain, and now she looked up with relief\\r\\nthat all was told.But the poor mother had borne all she could. She suddenly drooped and\\r\\nwould have fallen if the caller had not put strong arms about her and\\r\\nlaid her gently on the couch.\"My dear!\" she said as she stooped over the poor sufferer and patted\\r\\nher gently. \"My dear! Don\\'t feel so terribly about it. I am sure this\\r\\npart of the story should be a relief, for it certainly puts that man in\\r\\na position where he dare not touch your daughter again!\"\"But oh, to have my Daisy, my baby, mixed up with a man like that!\"\\r\\nwailed the utterly crushed little mother, \"It seems as though I never\\r\\ncan lift my head again!\"\"Oh, my dear! That is a very small part of the whole matter. The main\\r\\nthing is that no harm shall come to the child. No one here knows, of\\r\\ncourse, and he has promised!\"But a new voice broke in the room, clear and ringing and cold like a\\r\\nyoung Nemesis. \"What are you doing to my mother? Have you come here to\\r\\nmake more trouble for us? Who are you, anyway?\"THE girl stood in the doorway, her eyes flashing like blue flames, her\\r\\ndelicate profile outlined against the rich portier, chin lifted, in\\r\\nscorn, the light catching the glint of the waves in her pretty hair and\\r\\nturning them into gold, the delicate blue of her silk kimono bringing\\r\\nout the pearly tint of her skin, a haughty little patrician, insolent\\r\\nin her loveliness.Mary Dunlap looked at her in pity, and admiration, and a rising wonder.\\r\\nWas this the girl who had melted to tears in her arms but a few nights\\r\\nbefore, and implored her to protect her? How lovely she was even in\\r\\nher frenzy. She made a picture as she stood there in her rightful\\r\\nbackground. Poor, misguided infant! What a hard road she had set her\\r\\nfeet to travel, and how soon she must come to humiliation.But the mother was shocked into severity. \"Marguerite!\" she said,\\r\\nsitting bolt upright and looking at her daughter sternly, as she had\\r\\nnot looked at nor spoken to her since she was a very little girl,\\r\\n\"Marguerite! You forget yourself! You are beside yourself. Apologize\\r\\nat once to Mrs. Dunlap. You do not know what you are doing! Mrs.\\r\\nDunlap is the best friend you have in this world. She has gone to\\r\\ngreat inconvenience and expense and trouble to save you from an awful\\r\\ncalamity!\"The Marguerite of a few days ago would have been crushed to earth by\\r\\nsuch words from her beloved mother. Not so the girl of that night. She\\r\\ndid not even wince. Instead she drew herself up to her full height\\r\\nand looked her mother steadily in the eyes, as if their ages had been\\r\\nreversed, and spoke with a certain air of authority that was almost\\r\\nstartling.\"No, I am not beside myself, Mother! It is you who do not know what\\r\\nyou are doing. You have allowed yourself to be blinded by an utter\\r\\nstranger. You have swallowed whole the lies she has handed out to\\r\\nyou. Mother, I understand it all now. This woman is a rank imposter,\\r\\nemployed by others to ruin the reputation of a prominent and successful\\r\\nbusiness man, in order to extort money from him. Oh, I have heard a\\r\\nlot that she has been saying! Don\\'t try to stop me. Isn\\'t this kind of\\r\\nthing being done every day now? The daily papers are full of it. Why,\\r\\neven novels are just full of plots like that.\"Didn\\'t that horrid woman whose latest book is being lauded in every\\r\\ncolumn of reviews make one of her characters boast of being a daughter\\r\\nof Eve to some purpose because she had told some successful lies about\\r\\none of her victims? I tell you, Mother, you don\\'t know the world. Times\\r\\nhave changed since you were a girl. You think every woman is good,\\r\\nsimply because she is a woman and dresses respectably. That is why you\\r\\nare willing to believe all these terrible things about Rufus, and why\\r\\nyou want me to believe them. Just because a woman has told you. Just\\r\\nask her how much she is to be paid to bring about his ruin. Ask her\\r\\nthat! Do you suppose she is to be paid whether she succeeds or not?\\r\\nIt must be she isn\\'t; that is why she is so persistent, sneaking in\\r\\nto tell tales to you when I\\'m not by, and get you on her side. She\\r\\nevidently is afraid she is going to lose her money!\"\"Marguerite! Oh, my poor child!\" exclaimed the mother in horror,\\r\\nbeginning to cry. \"Oh, Mrs. Dunlap, I beg you will forgive her. She\\r\\ndoesn\\'t know what she is saying.\"\"That is perfectly all right, Mrs. Sheldon, don\\'t think of it for a\\r\\nmoment. I understand.\"But the girl\\'s voice broke in scornfully:\"I certainly do know what I am saying. I understand it all perfectly. I\\r\\ncan see the plot clearly now. I remember how this woman sat behind us\\r\\nin the cars, doubtless of purpose, listening to us. She was writing all\\r\\nthe afternoon. I suppose she took down our private conversation. She\\r\\nprobably carries on such business constantly, and chooses her victims\\r\\namong those who look as if they would care about their reputations and\\r\\nhave plenty of money to hush up such tales. That is called blackmail,\\r\\nMother, and I\\'ve read quite a lot about it in the papers. But they\\r\\nare not going to frighten us. Rufus and I will search this thing out\\r\\nto the foundations and make it impossible for this woman ever to get\\r\\nin her deadly work on any other good Christian man. It would be even\\r\\nworth sacrificing ourselves if we could do that. It is because people\\r\\nare afraid that they succumb to such things as this. We are not afraid!\\r\\nThis woman listened to our plans and discussions, and knew just where\\r\\nto get us, that is all. If I hadn\\'t been such a fool, I would have\\r\\nunderstood at the time, and I shouldn\\'t have yielded to the spell she\\r\\ncast over me. She must be a hypnotist. She somehow succeeded in making\\r\\neverything look different from what it really is. But she can\\'t do it\\r\\nagain. I\\'ve got my eyes open!\"These are a few of the indignant sarcasms that the two long-suffering\\r\\nwomen had to listen to as the evening passed on. Mrs. Sheldon,\\r\\nmortified to the extreme of agony over the way her daughter was raving\\r\\nout against the wonderful woman who had saved her from a life of\\r\\nhumiliation; alarmed beyond measure for the sanity of the one who was\\r\\ndearer to her than life, roused from her own weakness and tried every\\r\\npossible means to bring the girl to reason, all to no purpose.At last Mary Dunlap who had stood by helpless, trying to think of\\r\\nsomething she might say which would bring the girl to her senses,\\r\\nleaned over toward the mother and said in a low tone:\"Suppose I just go away for the night now. She is excited and the sight\\r\\nof me only irritates her. If she could get some sleep she might be more\\r\\nreasonable in the morning. No, don\\'t get up. I can find my own way to\\r\\nthe door. You can telephone if you need me. I shall stay close to my\\r\\nroom till I hear from you. And I will pray! Don\\'t despair, dear sister!\\r\\nGod is strong! Now—I will just slip away!\"The keen ears of the excited girl caught the last sentence.\"Yes, slip away by all means! I should have thought it might have\\r\\noccurred to you to do so before!\" she flung after the stranger.And then, as the door closed after Mary Dunlap, Marguerite Sheldon\\r\\nbegan to pace the floor, the very personification of indignant fury.After she had exhausted herself with wild words, she suddenly flung\\r\\nherself down before her mother with her head in her mother\\'s lap and\\r\\nbegan to sob:\"Oh, Mother, Mother, that dreadful woman has made me almost crazy!\" she\\r\\nsobbed. \"Some of the time I don\\'t seem to know what I am saying. But\\r\\nI know this, and I mean it. I know that Rufus is true to me, and not\\r\\nonly to me, but to God. He is very religious, Mother, he really is! You\\r\\nought to hear him talk. And Mother, I know I love him, love him, with\\r\\nmy whole soul! And I shall, forever and ever! No matter how many fiends\\r\\nfrom the underworld combine to try and make me false to him!\"At the word \"love\" her sobbing suddenly ceased and she sprang to her\\r\\nfeet and began pacing up and down the room again; her voice rising to\\r\\nalmost a shriek.Of what use to attempt any further words with one who was surely not\\r\\nresponsible for what she said or did? The mother slipped to her knees\\r\\nand began to pray.A voice of power spoke to her soul, while she was still on her knees,\\r\\nseeking help. It almost seemed to her that she had heard the spoken\\r\\nwords:\"\\'I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; I will lead them\\r\\nin paths that they have not known. I will make darkness light before\\r\\nthem; and crooked things straight.\\'\"Oh, the wonderful words! Could there be a human being any blinder than\\r\\nher Daisy? And, how terribly she needed new \"paths!\"It was because of this amazing voice that she was able to get through\\r\\nthat night, and the early part of the next day and finally to persuade\\r\\nher daughter to receive Mrs. Dunlap in the evening, and hear from her\\r\\nlips what she had to tell.This was in accordance with that lady\\'s earnest request made over the\\r\\ntelephone, she having decided that the mother was physically unable\\r\\nto endure further strain. But that Christian worker had certainly\\r\\noccasion to look back upon the hour spent with Daisy Sheldon as one of\\r\\nthe hardest in her by no means easy life. Not that Daisy did not try,\\r\\nat least at first, to treat her in accordance with all the rules of\\r\\npropriety.But as the story progressed, there was all the time in the narrator\\'s\\r\\nmind the question, \"How shall I convince this girl that I am speaking\\r\\nonly truth!\" She who was used to being trusted implicitly, and quoted\\r\\nas unquestioned authority on all points connected with the work to\\r\\nwhich she had given her life!Yet this girl listened in outward calm to the story that had caused her\\r\\nmother\\'s lapse into almost unconsciousness, with a half smile on her\\r\\nlips, that deepened into a sneer when she finally spoke:\"That is a very strange story, Mrs. Dunlap! Being as well acquainted\\r\\nwith Mr. Keller as I am, I don\\'t quite understand how I could be\\r\\nexpected to credit it! I should really like to see a photograph of\\r\\nthis mysterious person, to help me in conceiving how a woman of your\\r\\ndiscernment could have been so deceived! Although I should remember\\r\\nthat your acquaintance with Mr. Keller covered a very brief space of\\r\\ntime; while he is, of course, my closest friend.\"Could this be the girl who had so very recently clung to her, weeping,\\r\\nand begging to be shielded from even the sight of the man who was her\\r\\n\"closest friend!\" How could Mrs. Dunlap help giving a second\\'s thought\\r\\nto such a question? But she turned swiftly from it and tried again.\"Wait, please,\" she said patiently, \"I must tell you the rest. I have\\r\\nhad a longer acquaintance with the man than you have heard as yet.\\r\\nAfter breakfast Mrs. Oliver asked him to take me into the library and\\r\\nshow me some prints while she attended to other duties, and when he had\\r\\nclosed and locked the doors, he threw himself on my mercy and begged me\\r\\nnot to wreck his household by telling his wife and children what I knew\\r\\nabout him. He did not attempt to deny that he was of course the same\\r\\nMr. Keller with whom I had held a long conversation two nights before.\"In fact, he frankly owned that you had been what he called a\\r\\n\\'temptation\\' to him, but that the marriage ceremony which he professed\\r\\nat that time to be about to enter into, had been only a joke, of\\r\\ncourse, intended to relieve your anxieties for being away from your\\r\\nmother longer than you had planned. I would not like to tear your heart\\r\\nnor soil my lips by repeating the words that he used to describe your\\r\\nwonderful mother and her ignorant prejudice as he called it.\"He also told me that his friend who posed as a minister for the time\\r\\nbeing was an amateur play actor who had successfully impersonated a\\r\\nclergyman while they were in college, which gave him the idea of a mock\\r\\nmarriage to quiet your protests.\"And now, I will show you a paper written and signed by this man, in\\r\\nwhich he pledges never to write or telegraph or telephone you, or\\r\\nvisit you again. It is a paper that I went back to secure, after I had\\r\\nstarted on this western trip, and the man knows that his keeping this\\r\\nagreement both in letter and spirit is the price of my silence toward\\r\\nhis wife and children. His wife is a charming and beautiful woman, and\\r\\nhis two daughters are as sweet and charming as yourself. It seemed\\r\\nterrible to wreck that home, but I would not keep silence unless I felt\\r\\nsure you would be safe forever from him.\"Marguerite Sheldon tilted her patrician chin haughtily, a little smile\\r\\nof scorn on her lovely lips.\"Mrs. Dunlap,\" she said, \"you certainly are mistress of your\\r\\nprofession. You have worked out your evil plot to the last detail, I\\r\\nsee. You must have gone to great pains to counterfeit Mr. Keller\\'s hand\\r\\nwriting. Perhaps stolen some of his own letters from my handbag to\\r\\ncopy while I slept. It is certainly cleverly done. And of course this\\r\\nremarkable interview is a part of the whole scheme. One wonders whether\\r\\nyou were cunning enough to concoct it on the spur of the moment, or\\r\\nwhether you had it all prepared in reserve, if you found I did not fall\\r\\nfor your story at once? Of course I know the daily papers are full of\\r\\nsuch tales of blackmail and the like. Perhaps if my tastes lay in that\\r\\ndirection and I had posted myself better on the ways of such people\\r\\nas you, I might have been saved even the first humiliation of giving\\r\\nway before you and yielding to your influence which I now thoroughly\\r\\nbelieve to have been hypnotic.\"Of course I might have saved your time by saying all this before I\\r\\nheard you, but my mother was so anxious that I should let you speak\\r\\nthat I have listened to your remarkable tale with what patience I could\\r\\nsummon. But now I think we have had enough of this farce. I wish to\\r\\ndistinctly state just now that I believe in Mr. Keller\\'s honor and\\r\\nintegrity as entirely as I did before this insane plot was planned; and\\r\\nuntil I hear from his own lips that he did not intend to marry me that\\r\\nnight, and that he is not Mr. Rufus Keller, and never was, I shall not\\r\\nbelieve one word of this story; and I shall remain as I am now, his\\r\\npromised wife until he comes to claim me.\"Before this outburst the baffled woman sat silent, dumbfounded. Such\\r\\nbeautiful faith in such a worthless man had never come her way. She was\\r\\nnot troubled over the insults that had been flung at her. The situation\\r\\nhad become too grave to be thinking of self. The question that fairly\\r\\nappalled her was, how was it possible to save this poor blind child\\r\\nfrom her own folly? Suddenly she resolved to try one more thing. It\\r\\nseemed the last resort.\"Miss Sheldon,\" she said, speaking earnestly and looking straight into\\r\\nthe flashing eyes of the angry girl, \"will you put this thing to the\\r\\ntest? Will you accompany me on the midnight Express to New York where I\\r\\nwill take you to call on Mr. Ralph Oliver in his private office, Number\\r\\n— Fifth Avenue, that he may tell you himself that he is the Mr. Keller\\r\\nwhom you know so well? I happen to know that he is to be in his office\\r\\nto-morrow morning. Will you go?\"What would the girl reply to this challenge?What she did was to rise in utter silence and move swiftly across\\r\\nthe room to the door, which she opened, and closed after her with a\\r\\ndistinct slam!MARY DUNLAP, left alone in the big beautiful room with the echo of the\\r\\nscornful young words, and the echo of that slammed door hurting into\\r\\nher soul, suddenly rested her elbow on the arm of the chair in which\\r\\nshe sat, and dropped her tired head upon her hand. With closed eyes\\r\\nshe prayed, her soul crying out from the depth of her failure. She had\\r\\ndone her best for this little sister and she had utterly failed. Now\\r\\nshe called upon her Father for sustaining strength, for light, for\\r\\nguidance, for calmness in the midst of despair; for the headstrong\\r\\nblinded girl, and for the worn despairing mother.Then out of her despair came peace, and suddenly a knowledge that the\\r\\nFather cared more than she did, even more than the stricken mother.She became aware of the entrance of that mother, quietly, like a little\\r\\nsad wraith.Lifting her head she tried to smile but failed.\"It was no use!\" she said sadly, \"She would not believe a word that I\\r\\nsaid.\"\"Oh, my dear strong friend!\" breathed the little mother, \"What should\\r\\nI do without you? I have been praying while you were down here. I\\r\\ncannot think my little girl is to be allowed to go to destruction, or\\r\\nlose her mind, or anything. She is a child of the covenant. Her father\\r\\nand I dedicated her to the Lord when she was born. He cannot desert\\r\\nus! You don\\'t think He would let her go like this, do you? She is—a\\r\\nchurch-member—of course—and has always seemed—a Christian. Haven\\'t I a\\r\\nright to claim His promises for my child?\"\"You certainly have,\" said the strong hearty voice. \"Come let us kneel\\r\\ndown now and claim that promise, \\'Where two of you shall agree as\\r\\ntouching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my\\r\\nFather.\\'\"So the two women knelt hand in hand beside the couch and poured out\\r\\ntheir hearts in prayer for the foolish girl, till it seemed that their\\r\\nyearning words must be already spread before the mercy seat, and\\r\\nperhaps the swift answer on its way; and new strength and courage came\\r\\ninto the mother\\'s heart.Upstairs there were hurrying footsteps for a few minutes, and then\\r\\nsilence, but if the two petitioners heard them it was only to be\\r\\nthankful that they were not the regular measured frantic tread that had\\r\\nbeen going back and forth all day. Perhaps she was resting at last.They rose with a peace upon their faces.\"Now,\" said Mary Dunlap, \"it is time you went to bed and to sleep.\\r\\nWe have put the whole matter in the Father\\'s hands and we cannot do\\r\\nanything else till He shows us. Suppose you run upstairs and see if\\r\\nshe is all right, and then, if she is resting, I will go back to the\\r\\nhotel and let you get to bed, for I\\'m sure I won\\'t be needed any more\\r\\nto-night.\"\"You have been so wonderful!\" murmured Mrs. Sheldon. \"What should I\\r\\nhave done without you? Why not stay here to-night? Our guest room is\\r\\nalways ready, and then we can talk things over in the morning.\"\"No,\" said Mary Dunlap decidedly. \"It is better for me to be out of the\\r\\nhouse. The child resents my presence just now, and will come to herself\\r\\ntwice as quickly if she is alone with her mother. Get a good night\\'s\\r\\nrest, and perhaps she will see things differently in the morning. Sleep\\r\\ndoes a great deal toward bringing sane vision.\"\"Oh, I do hope she is asleep! She never even lay down last night, just\\r\\nwalked the floor and talked in that wild frantic way and then cried! I\\r\\nnever saw anybody cry like that, so despairingly, so resentfully! It\\r\\nfrightened me! But really, I cannot let you go back to the hotel at\\r\\nthis time of night. It must be very late indeed. I\\'m sure I heard the\\r\\nmidnight train go down quite a few minutes ago. It isn\\'t safe for a\\r\\nwoman to be out alone so late.\"\"Nonsense!\" laughed Mary Dunlap. \"My dear, nobody would touch me. I\\'ve\\r\\nbeen out at all hours in all kinds of places, and shall often be if I\\r\\nlive. It doesn\\'t bother me a bit. Come, run up and see if the child\\r\\nis all right and then I\\'ll go. You mustn\\'t lose any more sleep. Can\\'t\\r\\nI just stand here at the foot of the stairs and you wave to me if all\\r\\nis well? Is the night latch on the door? And does that light turn out\\r\\nfrom above? Then I\\'ll shut the door after me, and you needn\\'t come down\\r\\nagain to-night. Good night, dear, brave, little mother. I\\'ll call you\\r\\nup in the morning and see how the Father is answering our prayer.\"Mrs. Sheldon pressed the other woman\\'s hand, and then tiptoed upstairs\\r\\nsoftly. Her footfalls were muffled in the heavy texture of costly\\r\\nrugs, and Mary Dunlap waited below, looking up for her signal, yawning\\r\\nwearily and suddenly realizing that she felt very old and tired.But the footsteps did not return at once as she had expected. It seemed\\r\\na long time before she suddenly heard Mrs. Sheldon almost running\\r\\nacross the floor above, rushing through the hall and down the stairs a\\r\\nfluttering paper in her hand. Her face was chalk white in the subdued\\r\\nlight of the hall chandelier and her eyes burned dark with fright.\"She is gone!\" she cried, her voice catching in a sob. \"She is not\\r\\nthere at all. She has gone to New York!\"She thrust a paper into Mrs. Dunlap\\'s hand and dropped down upon the\\r\\nlowest step of the stair in a little crushed heap, her face in her\\r\\nhands.Mrs. Dunlap was reading the letter that had been given her:\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dear Mother: (it read)\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0There is only one thing left for me to do, and that is to go to number\\r\\n— Fifth Avenue New York and Prove that there is no Mr. Ralph Oliver.\\r\\nAfter I have done that, I shall go and find Rufus and we will be\\r\\nmarried at once! It is my duty to save Rufus from this terrible plot\\r\\nagainst his character. After that, we will take care of you. Don\\'t\\r\\nworry. I will let you hear from me.\\n\\nLovingly,\\n\\nDAISY.\\n\\nMary Dunlap read the letter over twice, while Mrs. Sheldon cried\\r\\nsoftly. Then the elder woman spoke:\"I know what you are thinking. You think the Lord has not heard your\\r\\nprayer. But you must not think that. I heard a great preacher from\\r\\nEngland once say that we must learn to \\'trust Him where we could not\\r\\ntrace Him,\\' and I think that if God has been preparing this thing while\\r\\nwe were praying and claiming His promise, that in some way it is to\\r\\nanswer our prayer. Come, let us trust Him, and tell him so.\"Right there by the stairs Mary Dunlap prayed, talking to the Lord as\\r\\nif He stood where she could see Him, asking directions for what they\\r\\nshould do next.When the brief prayer was over the mother lifted her head and stood up.\"Daisy is not used to traveling alone! Especially out in the night this\\r\\nway, and to a great city!\" She spoke in a tone of deep anguish.\"She is not alone!\" said Mary Dunlap solemnly, \"God is with her!\"Then after an instant she added:\"And there is no reason why we should not follow, is there? Wouldn\\'t\\r\\nthat be what the Lord would want? When is the next train?\"\"Not until five o\\'clock in the morning,\" sighed the mother.\"Even so,\" said the steady traveler, \"we shall not be so far behind\\r\\nher, and perhaps this was the only way to convince her, to let her see\\r\\nthat it is all true. Sister, we\\'ve got to trust our Father! There just\\r\\nisn\\'t anything else to do!\"Daisy\\'s mother looked up with a weak little trembling smile and with\\r\\nlips that quivered as she spoke the words, said:\"All right!\"\"You good little sport!\" said Mary Dunlap, and stooped down and kissed\\r\\nher.\"Now,\" she said, \"sit down a minute while we plan. I\\'ll go back to the\\r\\nhotel and pack my grip. It takes just five minutes, I\\'ve done it in a\\r\\nhurry so many times. Then I\\'ll get all the information needed about the\\r\\ntrain, and order a taxi to come for us, and I\\'ll come back here. That\\r\\nought not to take me more than three quarters of an hour. Let me see.\\r\\nIt\\'s now quarter of one. I\\'ll be back here at half past. In the mean\\r\\ntime, are you strong enough to get together what few things you\\'ll need\\r\\non the way while I\\'m gone? And can\\'t you call your maid and give her\\r\\ndirections about leaving the house for a few days? You can telegraph\\r\\nher afterward of course if you forget anything. Is she trustworthy?\"\"She\\'s been with us fifteen years,\" said Mrs. Sheldon. \"She simply\\r\\ntakes care of us.\"\"That\\'s good then. Let\\'s go. Work fast, and be done when I get back so\\r\\nwe can get a few winks of sleep. Oh, yes, you\\'ve got to sleep or you\\r\\nwould be sick and that wouldn\\'t do. But you don\\'t need to bother about\\r\\nbreakfast. We\\'ll get that on the train. Now, I\\'m off!\"Mary Dunlap was as good as her word, did all she had promised to do\\r\\nwith a few minor details thrown in. She was efficiency itself when it\\r\\ncame to any kind of a crisis. She was back three minutes ahead of her\\r\\nschedule and standing over the poor bewildered mother, whose eyes kept\\r\\nblurring with tears as she tried to go about and gather up the things\\r\\nshe would need.\"Now,\" said Mary Dunlap looking down at the open suitcase, only half\\r\\npacked, \"what have you got in here? Night dress and toilet things? A\\r\\ncouple of other dresses, one for daytime and one for evening. Yes,\\r\\nyou can\\'t tell what we may run into on this jaunt! Always look out\\r\\nfor any emergency, and two extra dresses will generally do it. Now, a\\r\\nwarm kimono, slippers and another pair of shoes, a change of underwear\\r\\nthat\\'s about all. You\\'ll want to take your pen perhaps and a few extra\\r\\nhandkerchiefs. I\\'ve done this so much it is second nature. Sometimes I\\r\\nalmost have to live on the cars.\"\"It seems as if I just couldn\\'t think.\"\"Well, don\\'t try, I\\'ll do it for you. How about Daisy, did she take\\r\\nanything with her? She certainly didn\\'t have much time. It must have\\r\\nbeen after eleven o\\'clock when she went upstairs and she wrote that\\r\\nnote before she left.\"\"Yes, her suit case is gone. I don\\'t really know how much is missing.\\r\\nPerhaps she hadn\\'t fully unpacked it since she came home.\"\"Did she have money?\"\"I don\\'t know how much. She has her own bank account, and probably\\r\\nhas her check book. They know her at the station of course and would\\r\\ncash her check. That makes me think, I wonder how much money I have in\\r\\nthe house? Perhaps Daisy has taken it. She is always free to go to my\\r\\ndrawer when she runs out of money.\"\"Don\\'t worry about money. I always carry a few traveler\\'s checks and\\r\\nI had the hotel order tickets and chairs for us. They will come with\\r\\nthe taxi in the morning. Now, where do you keep your hat and coat and\\r\\ngloves? Is your hand bag ready? I want you to lie down this minute and\\r\\nget some sleep. No, don\\'t lie and think about Daisy. Just rest back on\\r\\nthe Father\\'s promise and relax. Everything is going to be all right!\"So Mrs. Sheldon, ready for her journey all but her dress, wrapped her\\r\\nkimono about her and was tucked up by Mary Dunlap. Surprisingly she\\r\\nwent to sleep, worn out with her two nights of vigil.Mary Dunlap slept too, little cat naps with a keen squint at her\\r\\nwristwatch with the aid of her ever ready flashlight stowed under her\\r\\npillow.It was she who slipped down to the strange kitchen at daybreak and made\\r\\nsome good strong coffee. It was she who carried it up and made Mrs.\\r\\nSheldon drink it. It was she who inspected the suit case at the last\\r\\nminute, snapped it shut and carried it down to the door, while Mrs.\\r\\nSheldon was giving a few last directions to the sleepy maid who had\\r\\nloyally stumbled down to say goodbye just as the taxi drew up at the\\r\\ndoor.They had been seated in the train for perhaps an hour when Mrs. Sheldon\\r\\nsaid with a troubled look:\"I almost wish I had asked Nelson to come with us. He is so dependable\\r\\nwhere Daisy is concerned, and it doesn\\'t seem quite fair to him to run\\r\\naway without a word. He is so—so—loyal and patient.\"\"H\\'m!\" mused Mary Dunlap. \"Was there—any way you could have asked him?\\r\\nWould Daisy have resented your telling him?\"\"I suppose she would. No, I don\\'t suppose there was,\" said the\\r\\nperplexed mother reversing the order of the questions, \"but somehow it\\r\\nseems all wrong not to have him along when we are in trouble.\"\"Well,\" said Mary Dunlap thoughtfully, \"if the Lord needs him, He\\'ll\\r\\nknow how to send him. Don\\'t you fret.\"Fortunately both women were dead with sleep, and were able to get\\r\\nsome real refreshing rest in their chairs while the miles raced along\\r\\nbeneath the wheels, and Daisy drew nearer to New York.What would Daisy do when she got to New York? Her mother could not keep\\r\\nthe question out of her mind, and yet she could not answer it. Oh, what\\r\\nawful experience might she not have if she went to that office and met\\r\\nher old lover! A creature as hardened as he would perhaps think nothing\\r\\nof spiriting her away somewhere, so that her mother might never see her\\r\\nagain. If she came early alone to his office and found him by himself,\\r\\nhe might tell her any lie, and in her present state of mind, she would\\r\\nbelieve it.On the other hand, what if that Mrs. Oliver or her daughters should\\r\\nhappen to be there when Daisy arrived, and she should say something to\\r\\nher lover which showed what her relation had been to him, would she and\\r\\nDaisy ever be able to live after such humiliation?The poor mother could not fathom the answer to her painful thoughts and\\r\\ncould only pray over and over again in her heart,—\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"Oh Father, keep her, keep my child from falling.\"\\n\\nAnd then like soothing balm there came to her familiar words,—\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"Able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before\\r\\nthe throne—without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.\"\\n\\nOh, how blessedly the old verses learned in childhood came trooping to\\r\\nher groping thoughts, as if the Father were speaking them to her heart,\\r\\nwhile the train carried her on her way.The long day was accomplished at last, a day during which both the\\r\\nwomen slept a good deal and talked a little, finding out common points\\r\\nof contact, common interests between one another, speaking of Daisy now\\r\\nand then; of Nelson Whitney occasionally; of Daisy\\'s wonderful father;\\r\\nand Mrs. Sheldon\\'s girlhood. As the night drew on and the lights began\\r\\nto appear, the two women began to feel as if they had known each other\\r\\nfor years, and were bound by ties closer even than sisters might have\\r\\nbeen. Then there was the long night, to be waked through, thinking of\\r\\nthe possibilities of the morrow.\"Now,\" said Mary Dunlap looking at her wristwatch the next morning\\r\\nafter they had had breakfast, and come back to their section, in the\\r\\nsleeper, \"it\\'s quarter of nine. We shall be in, in three quarters of an\\r\\nhour, and take a taxi straight to Fifth Avenue if there isn\\'t time to\\r\\ngo to a hotel. Nothing opens in New York much before ten o\\'clock. Daisy\\r\\ngot in last night, but all offices were closed. She couldn\\'t have done\\r\\nanything till this morning, and she can\\'t get there much ahead of us.\\r\\nAt least if she does, she won\\'t see him, for I\\'m sure he never comes\\r\\ndown to the office before ten, and sometimes later. Take heart, sister,\\r\\nand trust the Father. He is managing this business, and I fancy He\\r\\ncould have taken care of Daisy even if we hadn\\'t come along. You know\\r\\nHe manages a lot of things without us!\"Mrs. Sheldon blinked back the tears and smiled.\"I know,\" she said. \"I\\'ll try to rest on Him.\"And then they began to draw near to the great city, and the two women\\r\\nput on hats and coats, and sat up ready for action. Who knew what the\\r\\nday had in store for them?NELSON WHITNEY rang the bell of the Sheldon House at exactly quarter\\r\\npast eight the next morning. It was as early as he felt it would be\\r\\nat all courteous to disturb the household, especially as one of the\\r\\nmembers had not been feeling well the night before.Mary, the trusted servant of the years, opened the door to him.\"Good morning, Mary,\" he said familiarly, for he had been almost as\\r\\nmuch at home in the Sheldon house since childhood as in his own home.\\r\\n\"Is Marguerite up yet? I don\\'t like to disturb her, but she was to have\\r\\nsome measurements written out for the things she wanted me to get for\\r\\nthe Hospital Fair, and I rather think she is expecting me to see to it\\r\\nthis morning.\"\"Miss Marguerite is away, Mr. Nelson,\" said Mary with disapproval in\\r\\nher voice.Mary had been with the family too long not to know every time one of\\r\\nthe beloved family winked an eye or shed a tear, and Mary felt that\\r\\nthings were all wrong just now; the idol of her heart crying and\\r\\ncarrying on all day and then running away on the midnight train, and\\r\\nher mother going at daybreak! It certainly was not right.\"Away?\" said Nelson. \"Why, she was here yesterday, wasn\\'t she? Her\\r\\nmother told me she was lying down with a headache last evening when I\\r\\ntelephoned.\"\"Sure she was here last evening,\" said Mary, glad to get someone to\\r\\nshare her troubles. \"I don\\'t know whatever her mother was thinking\\r\\nabout to let her go, and her having headaches and crying and all\\r\\nyesterday. But young folks, seems to do about as they please nowadays.\"Whitney cast her a pleasant grin, but his eyes showed that he was\\r\\ntroubled.\"Well, I guess then I\\'ll have to see Mrs. Sheldon. If she isn\\'t about\\r\\njust ask her, please, if Marguerite left any word with her. Or, if\\r\\nshe\\'s asleep yet or anything, just look on Marguerite\\'s desk and see if\\r\\nyou find a paper with my name on it. She\\'s likely written it out and\\r\\nleft it there.\"\"M\\'s Sheldon\\'s gone too,\" burst forth Mary. \"She left on the five\\r\\no\\'clock with some woman was here all evening and come back and stayed\\r\\nall night, what there was left of it when they got packed.\"Whitney looked up startled.\"Mrs. Sheldon has gone too? And she didn\\'t go with Marguerite? That is\\r\\nstrange. There wasn\\'t a death in the family or anything near relatives\\r\\nin New York perhaps? I believe they have relatives there, haven\\'t they?\\r\\nPerhaps they telegraphed for Marguerite.\"\"No, it couldn\\'t a been that, all the Sheldons and Hamptons in New York\\r\\nwent to Europe a month ago—went for a year.\"\"Well, it\\'s none of my business of course,\" said Whitney with a grave\\r\\nsmile that ended with a sigh, \"but what in sixty am I going to do about\\r\\nthat committee? They\\'ll be in my hair if I don\\'t get those things for\\r\\nto-night, and they told me Marguerite had the list. She probably forgot\\r\\nto say anything to you about it, Mary, going in such a hurry. Suppose\\r\\nyou go up and look around her room and see if you see anything that\\r\\nlooks like a list, whether it has my name on it or not.\"\"Come on in, then,\" said Mary graciously, and opened the door wider.Whitney stepped in and stood in the hall, his glance searching toward\\r\\nthe open doorway where he had stood two nights before, talking to\\r\\nMrs. Sheldon. Who was that other woman? Was she connected with this\\r\\nsudden exodus? He had liked her. She seemed a strong true friend. He\\r\\nremembered the twinkle in her eyes, though they had looked grave, even\\r\\nsorrowful as if she was full of sympathy.He sighed again as he remembered how strange it was to have the family\\r\\ngo off this way without telling him. Heretofore he had always been told\\r\\nof every change from day to day. His life had been so closely twined\\r\\nwith theirs that they never even changed a piece of furniture from one\\r\\nroom to another without asking him gaily how he liked it in its new\\r\\nplace, always joyously consulting him about any action. When they were\\r\\ngoing away, it was always he who got their reservations, checked their\\r\\nbaggage, and took them to the station in his car, that is, since he had\\r\\nbeen old enough to have a car. Before that he attended them in a hired\\r\\ntaxi.But now, the last few months, there had been growing a change. Mrs.\\r\\nSheldon was just the same, but Marguerite had a certain reserve, as if\\r\\nhe didn\\'t matter any more. It was all since that night when the Farr\\r\\ngirl brought that Keller fellow with her to their literary club, and\\r\\nintroduced him to Marguerite. Whitney had heard him calling her \"Daisy\"\\r\\nthe very first night; \"Daisy,\" the name that belonged exclusively to\\r\\nher mother—and himself—up to that night!After that, he studiously called her Marguerite. He wanted no name for\\r\\nhis girl that he had to share with that man! He was a villain, that\\'s\\r\\nwhat he was, a middle-aged man coming in and presuming to monopolize a\\r\\ngirl almost young enough to be his daughter! What was he anyway, and\\r\\nwhat did they know about him? He meant to make it his business pretty\\r\\nsoon to find out, if he persisted in coming around as he had been doing.Then Mary\\'s voice sailed down the stairway.\"Was it a list of flower seeds and bulbs, you meant, Mr. Nelson?\"Whitney walked over to the foot of the stairs and looked up.\"No, Mary, it would be lumber, and canvas, and curtain material for the\\r\\nstage setting for the Cantata.\"\"Oh,\" said Mary, \"this ain\\'t it, then, I\\'ll look again.\"Mary went back into the girl\\'s room, and the young man stood there\\r\\nwaiting. He moved his position impatiently and drew another sigh, and\\r\\nsomething crackled under his foot. A paper! Probably that was the list.\\r\\nMarguerite had left it on the hall table and it had blown across the\\r\\nfloor when the door was opened.He stooped and picked it up. Yes, it was Marguerite\\'s writing. Probably\\r\\nsome directions about color and fabrics. Maybe a bit of a word of\\r\\napology for going so hurriedly, or even a friendly goodbye. His heart\\r\\nwas lifted at the thought. His eyes plunged into the midst of the words\\r\\nin the dim light of the hall, and grasped, searching for that personal\\r\\nword which he so longed to read. So before he was aware that he was\\r\\nreading a note addressed to someone else, he had gathered the whole\\r\\nunhappy truth.For an instant he stood with the paper quivering in his hand, a sense\\r\\nof mortification upon him for having read something he shouldn\\'t, yet a\\r\\ngreat sinking within his soul for the facts that had been revealed in\\r\\nthat brief note.So then Daisy Marguerite had gone away without her mother\\'s knowledge!\\r\\nMarguerite to have done a thing like that! She would never have done\\r\\nthat a year ago! Something terrible must have happened to get her\\r\\nwrought up to the degree that she would worry her much-loved mother by\\r\\ndoing that.And of course that explained the mother\\'s hasty leave by the next\\r\\ntrain. Mrs. Sheldon would never allow that quietly without doing\\r\\nsomething about it. But why, oh, why hadn\\'t she telephoned to him? That\\r\\nis what she would have done even a few weeks ago! Oh, and what was that\\r\\nother awful thing the note had said? When she had accomplished her\\r\\nstrange mission, whatever it was, trying to prove that somebody did not\\r\\nexist, she was going to hunt up that unspeakable villain Keller and\\r\\nmarry him! Could any calamity loom greater than that to Nelson Whitney\\r\\nin the whole bright world that had suddenly gone black?At that instant, while he was turning over those awful facts and trying\\r\\nto make something out of them, he heard Mary\\'s brisk footsteps coming\\r\\ndown the stairs. Instantly he crushed the paper he held and drove his\\r\\nhand deep into his overcoat pocket.\"I can\\'t find it nowheres, Mr. Nelson,\" she said, \"would you like to go\\r\\nup and look? You might recognize it when I wouldn\\'t.\"Nelson sprang up the steps hastily.\"I\\'ll just take a look about,\" he said.But it was not for the list he wanted to go up. He had a feeling that\\r\\nhe must look about the apartment where she had last been as if its very\\r\\nwalls must cry out and give him a clue to go by, some hope for his\\r\\nanguished soul that was all wrapped up in the little girl he had loved\\r\\nsince childhood, the little girl about to step off into danger! What\\r\\ncould he do about it?But the room was in perfect order, as Marguerite\\'s room always was,\\r\\nnothing about to tell any tales, save her little blue sweater, lying\\r\\non the bed in a heap as if it had suddenly been cast aside. He stood\\r\\nfor an instant in the doorway, looking around, walked to her desk and\\r\\nher bureau with a keen swift glance, went back toward the door. Pausing\\r\\nsuddenly beside the bed, he picked up the soft little wool garment and\\r\\nlaid it to his cheek, just an instant, like a caress, and dropping it,\\r\\nwent out of the room and ran swiftly down the stairs.\"D\\'ya find it?\" asked Mary noting triumphantly that he had no list in\\r\\nhis hand.\"No, Mary, it wasn\\'t there,\" he said. \"Thank you. She must have\\r\\nforgotten it. I\\'ll have to get along the best way I can without it.\"\"Well, if it turns up when I go to sweep, I\\'ll phone you to the office,\\r\\nMr. Nelson.\"\"Thank you, Mary, and by the way, they didn\\'t say when they were\\r\\nreturning, did they? Or give you an address? I might get her on Long\\r\\nDistance you know.\"\"No, they didn\\'t say. M\\'s Sheldon she did say that ef they decided to\\r\\nstay mor\\'na day ur so, she\\'d write and tell me what hotel they put up\\r\\nat. Ef she does, I\\'ll phone ya, Mr. Nelson.\"\"All right, Mary. Thank you!\" said Nelson Whitney, and closing the door\\r\\nbehind him, went out into the street.As he got into his car and threw in the clutch, it suddenly came to him\\r\\nwhat he must do. His people were off alone, in possible trouble, and he\\r\\nmust be at hand ready if they needed him! He must go to New York and\\r\\nfind them.But how could he find them since each detachment of them had the start\\r\\nof him, and might be lost in New York long before he could get there?He began to calculate distance and time. Marguerite a whole night ahead\\r\\nof him, and her mother several hours\\' start! When he reached New York,\\r\\nthey might have already left it. Marguerite might already be married.\\r\\nAnd even if he were there, unless he got there ahead and met their\\r\\ntrains, how would he know where they had gone?Stay! Hadn\\'t that note told a place where Marguerite was going? He\\r\\npulled out the crumpled paper and smoothed it, getting the number fixed\\r\\nin his mind. — Fifth Avenue! Well, at least, he knew one place where\\r\\nshe intended to go, if there was such a place. Her note seemed to imply\\r\\nthat she doubted it. But there would at least be the number whether the\\r\\nperson whose existence she was seeking to disprove, was there or not.Yes, with only that little clue, and no chance at all of getting\\r\\nthere on time, he meant to go after her! For what could her mother\\r\\ndo? True she might have more information of her whereabouts than was\\r\\ncontained in that note, but even so, she was a woman of another day\\r\\nand generation, a woman used to being cared for, and not accustomed to\\r\\ntraveling by herself. That other woman had looked capable, of course,\\r\\nas if she might go around the world by herself, and have no trouble\\r\\nwhatever, but who knew whether that other woman—Dunlap her name was,\\r\\nwasn\\'t it—who knew, whether she was going all the way to New York or\\r\\nnot?Yes, he must go! And there was only one way to get there in time to be\\r\\nof use. Could he do it?He drove hard down to his office, a very new office with a new\\r\\nsecretary and office boy, new desks and chairs and typewriter, and\\r\\nnew clientele. This was a busy day, too, but that couldn\\'t be helped\\r\\neither. His boss in Chicago was not a hard master, and anyway his\\r\\nsecretary was efficient if she was rather old and homely.He plunged into his morning mail. That must be got out of the way\\r\\nfirst. Matilda Herrick, the shell-rimmed secretary, had it all in neat\\r\\norder for him; the new orders, the old customers, the complaints, the\\r\\nletter from the head office in Chicago. He went through the piles\\r\\nrapidly, giving a word of direction now and then.\"Get these letters ready for me as soon as you can,\" he said. \"I may\\r\\nhave to go to New York to-day. Call up Bainbridge and find out if he is\\r\\nready to talk business yet. Get Hetherington on the phone and see if\\r\\nhe has heard from that order he took yesterday, and send the boy up to\\r\\nmy home to get my suit case. He had better go as soon as he has those\\r\\nenvelopes addressed. There\\'ll be time.\"When Matilda Herrick had taken her gaunt ability out of his private\\r\\noffice, he locked his door and went down on his knees beside his desk.\\r\\nHe was a young man who traveled under Guidance and went nowhere without\\r\\norders.When he got up from his knees there was a look of purpose on his face\\r\\nthat had not been there before. He reached for his telephone and called\\r\\na number.A hearty voice answered it promptly.Whitney\\'s face lighted with relief.\"Hello, Bert, is that you?\"\"Sure is! Hello, Nell. Glad to hear your voice! How\\'s crops?\"\"Oh, growing, growing fast. Say, Bert, flying anywhere to-day?\"\"Sure thing. Want to go?\"\"If you\\'re going in the right direction. What\\'s your chart?\"\"Wherever you say. You never thought you could spare the time to go\\r\\nwith me before.\"\"Happen to be going anywhere within a hundred miles of New York?\"\"Flying right to Fifth Avenue, this afternoon, if you\\'ll accompany me.\\r\\nGot a bit of engine trouble to make right, it\\'ll take a couple of hours\\r\\nto fix, then I\\'m ready. How soon can you start?\"\"I could make it any time after one if things go well here.\"\"Make it snappy and we\\'ll paint New York red to-night.\"\"I\\'d prefer white, if you don\\'t mind, Bert.\"\"O. K. with me Nellie, just so\\'s you go along. Meet me at the field at\\r\\ntwo o\\'clock.\"Whitney hung up with an awed look in his face.\"It seems to be in the plan,\" he said to himself reverently, and began\\r\\nto work at several matters of business that he knew must be set right\\r\\nbefore he could honorably leave his own city.It seemed beautiful to him the way everything worked out, no\\r\\nhindrances, not a single hitch in the things that must be finished\\r\\nbefore he left. Every man he called on the telephone was in, every\\r\\nreport of sales was such that he could give the important directions\\r\\nconcerning them before he went away.\"It\\'s just as if somebody else was working with me to smooth the way,\"\\r\\nhe thought.The hours of the morning sped. Matilda Herrick had the letters ready\\r\\nfor signing in plenty of time. Everything went smoothly.Nelson Whitney telephoned his mother to pack his suit case for a quick\\r\\ntrip, and the office boy did all the rest, including accompanying his\\r\\nchief to the flying field, and driving the car back to the garage\\r\\nagain. At two-thirty exactly they were off, through the clear blue\\r\\nether, Nelson Whitney\\'s first experience in flying.For a few minutes the thrill of the new sensation occupied every\\r\\nsense, but after he was accustomed to the thought of sailing with the\\r\\nclouds, and looking down upon earth, he began to think of what was\\r\\nbefore him in New York. Was this a wild-goose chase he was going on?\\r\\nWouldn\\'t anybody, just anybody think he was a fool to start off with as\\r\\nlittle warrant as he had had? Wasn\\'t there danger of making his lady\\r\\neverlastingly angry chasing her this way, even if he did find her?\\r\\nWouldn\\'t even her mother have a right to resent it?And what, pray, was he to do when he arrived in New York, beyond the\\r\\nmere meeting the trains at the station, and getting in touch with\\r\\nthe people he was trying to help? How could he do that? Just walk up\\r\\nsmiling and say he knew they were expected so he met them? He hadn\\'t\\r\\nreally any warrant for that. Of course he could say that Mary told him\\r\\nwhat train they had taken, but he would feel like a fool saying that to\\r\\nMrs. Sheldon. Her keen eyes would see that there was something behind\\r\\nit all, and perhaps she might resent his intrusion into her affairs,\\r\\nthough she had always acted, hitherto, as if he belonged to her scheme\\r\\nof life.And what could he do before her train arrived to keep Marguerite in\\r\\nsight? If he met her train, she would be likely to be indignant. He\\r\\ncould not tell her he had found her note on the floor, and read it,\\r\\nthough it was addressed to her mother, and that he was here to protect\\r\\nher from whatever evil, real or fancied, threatened her. Assuredly he\\r\\nwould meet her train and try to appear as casual as possible, but he\\r\\nshrank inexpressibly from the look of scorn her dear eyes would cast at\\r\\nhim.There was no question but that Marguerite would resent his entrance\\r\\nonto the stage at this point in her career. She had been most haughty\\r\\nand independent of late, and it stung him even to remember her careless\\r\\nindifference.And failing to get suitable touch with his girl at the train, if he\\r\\nshould go to hunt up that number of Fifth Avenue, and should find it\\r\\nthere, what would he do? And what if it were not there? And where lived\\r\\nthis Keller man who was apparently making all this trouble? Why! He\\r\\nought to have telephoned somebody and found that out before he left!\\r\\nHere he was thinking he had done everything up in fine shape and he had\\r\\nleft out one of the strategic points in the whole matter. Of course he\\r\\ncould telephone back when he got to New York, but a lot of time might\\r\\nbe lost.However, was he not traveling under guidance? Could not He who had\\r\\nsmoothed the way thus far manage it so that he would go to the right\\r\\nplace, do the right thing? Would not the way open as he advanced?\\r\\nHe had put himself under the guidance of the greatest Leader in the\\r\\nuniverse, and there he must trust and not be afraid.The silver wings that bore him above the earth flew straight on, over\\r\\nwide stretches of the map. Sometimes he looked down wondering, when he\\r\\nsaw a railroad train creeping along like a small worm on the earth, if\\r\\nperhaps he might be looking at the very train in which those he went to\\r\\nprotect were traveling.The strange thing about it all was that though he was positive they\\r\\nneeded protection, he was not in the least sure from what he was\\r\\nprotecting them. Only in the case of the girl, if it should come about\\r\\nthat she tried to carry out her threat of marrying that man Keller,\\r\\nhe knew he must prevent it. He felt that it could be nothing short of\\r\\na calamity for her, to say nothing of her mother and himself, if that\\r\\nshould ever come to pass. He felt, too, that God was on his side, for\\r\\nhad he not put himself and his plans in the hands of God, willing to\\r\\nbe guided, willing to have all plans overturned if they were not the\\r\\nright thing? And the way had been smoothed before him. Nothing had been\\r\\nhindered of the least detail to stop him from going through the air.So the silver wings flew on, and in due time Nelson Whitney arrived in\\r\\nNew York.He did not help his friend in painting the town red. Instead he went\\r\\ndirectly to the Pennsylvania station and got full details of all trains\\r\\narriving from the West. He found that Marguerite\\'s train was due to\\r\\narrive late that evening. He begged off from going with his friend\\r\\nlonger than to dinner, and went straight back to the station where he\\r\\nmade himself well acquainted with the various exits of the train, and\\r\\nfound the best place to watch and await her.It had not been hard to discover just where the train would come\\r\\nin, and he had established himself behind the great iron bars just\\r\\nabove the train floor, where he could look down upon the disembarking\\r\\npassengers without being seen by them unless they deliberately turned\\r\\naround and looked up, but near enough to the train gate to get to her\\r\\nat once if he should see she was in any need of a friend, or was at all\\r\\nhesitant which way to turn.During the long day, he had had full opportunity to plan what he would\\r\\nsay when he met her. He would tell how he had called at the house for\\r\\nher list, and Mary had said she had gone to New York on the midnight\\r\\ntrain. So when he was invited to fly with his friend to the same city,\\r\\nhe thought he would meet her train and ask her about the list, in case\\r\\nhe went back the next day. That was a perfectly reasonable story as\\r\\nwell as being absolutely true, for his friend had many times invited\\r\\nhim to fly, and had told him to call him when he could go.Nevertheless he wished to reconnoiter before he approached her. It\\r\\nwas even conceivable that that Keller person might have somehow got\\r\\nin touch with her, and be traveling with her. His blood boiled at the\\r\\nthought, and he stood for twenty long minutes till the train arrived,\\r\\nthinking over what he should do if that were the case. He decided that\\r\\nhe would in any event go to the gate and speak to Marguerite. It might\\r\\neven be that a face from home might influence her, hinder her, from any\\r\\nfoolish thing she might be going to do. At least he would ask where she\\r\\nwas staying, and perhaps let her know that her mother was on the way,\\r\\njust casually, as if of course she knew it.He would be able to judge a great deal from the way she took what he\\r\\nsaid.In the mean time, while he mused, in not a little anxiety, forgetting\\r\\nfor the moment his Guide, the train came in. The stream of people like\\r\\nants, came filing up the iron stairs to the gateways, and not one of\\r\\nthem escaped the anxious eye of Nelson Whitney, as he stood in his\\r\\nsheltered nook behind a bunch of train flags and gate signs and waited.But Marguerite did not appear.She did not even come up in the elevator, which was in full view from\\r\\nhis position. He was sure he had not missed her, yet a frenzy of\\r\\nanxiety seized him. Perhaps she had seen him and had evaded him while\\r\\nhe was looking the other way!Where was Marguerite?WHAT had happened to Marguerite was this.She had never been to New York before, although she had traveled with\\r\\nher father and mother now and then in other directions. She knew\\r\\nnothing, of course, about the city save what she had gleaned from\\r\\noccasional references to it in novels. When the porter of the Pullman\\r\\nasked her before they reached Manhattan Transfer whether she was going\\r\\nuptown or downtown she looked at him bewildered for an instant. Then\\r\\nreasoning that an office building would likely be downtown, and she\\r\\nwanted to be near to the place where she intended going the first thing\\r\\nin the morning, she answered after that instant\\'s hesitation,—\"Oh, yes, downtown. I\\'m going downtown.\"\"Then you get out at Manhattan Transfer, lady,\" said the porter eyeing\\r\\nher a bit questioningly, she thought, because she had said downtown at\\r\\nthat time of night.Manhattan Transfer looked wide and desolate and empty. There were\\r\\nfew passengers so late and there seemed to be no official in charge.\\r\\nMarguerite stood aimlessly for a few minutes, looking this way and\\r\\nthat, wandering up, and then down, looking off at the dim distance of\\r\\nstars and weird lights. Was this the great New York about which she had\\r\\nheard so much?But at last a train came. A brakeman on the step, swinging a lantern,\\r\\nand yelling some unintelligible thing condescended to listen to her\\r\\nplea.\"Where you wantta go, lady? Uptown or downtown?\" The same mystical\\r\\nquestion, and it must have been all wrong the way she answered it\\r\\nbefore.\"Oh, I don\\'t know which,\" she cried, almost in tears, for she was\\r\\nsuddenly realizing her lonely situation at this late hour. \"I want to\\r\\ngo to a good respectable hotel.\"\"You go uptown lady, then. You get on the next train that comes by,\\r\\nover that side of the platform; be \\'long in five minutes now. Take you\\r\\nto the Pennsylvania Station, good hotel right across the street. All\\r\\nAboard!\"And he swung away, leaving her more desolate than ever, for now the\\r\\nwind-swept platform was empty of the few travelers who had been waiting\\r\\nfor this train, and Marguerite dared not go in search of any official\\r\\nwho might be inside the shelters lest she miss her train. Thus it was\\r\\nthat she arrived at the great station almost an hour later than the\\r\\ntrain by which she should have come. Emerging into the gloom, and\\r\\nclimbing the midnight stairs into the wide upper area, she felt smaller\\r\\nand more alone even than when she had stood on the high barren sweep of\\r\\nManhattan Transfer.There was noise and light here, a blare of it, and a strange midnight\\r\\nclatter that frightened her.If it had not been for a kindly agent of the Traveller\\'s Aid who\\r\\nhappened by just as she emerged from the iron gate, and said, noting\\r\\nher hesitancy, \"Can I help you?\" she might have stood there all night\\r\\nperhaps, afraid to venture into that vast empty floor like a little\\r\\nvessel setting sail to an unknown port.But the friendly Traveller\\'s Aid soon had the weary girl safely\\r\\nestablished in the great hotel across the way, and possessed of all the\\r\\ninformation she needed to get herself to the desired number on Fifth\\r\\nAvenue in the morning.Mind and body cannot continue forever in a state of violent emotion\\r\\nwithout some rest, and Marguerite, finding herself at last in a quiet\\r\\nroom with a luxurious bed, and nothing she could possibly do until\\r\\nmorning, succumbed to her weariness and fell into a deep sleep.She intended quite fully to waken about seven o\\'clock, get herself\\r\\nin readiness for her errand, and then try to get in touch with Rufus\\r\\nKeller. She thought she had a pretty good idea where to telegraph him,\\r\\nand felt that if she did so, it would only be a matter of a few hours\\r\\nbefore she had word that he was coming to her at once.She was not well enough versed in the ways of travelers to leave an\\r\\norder at the hotel desk to have them call her at seven, and if she had\\r\\nbeen, she would have been too confident that it was unnecessary. She\\r\\nhad prided herself for years on her ability to set herself to waken any\\r\\ntime at all, and never fail to waken on the minute. However that was,\\r\\nit turned out that she slept on straight past seven, past eight, past\\r\\nnine, past ten, past eleven, and never wakened till quarter to twelve\\r\\no\\'clock, dazed and vague as to where she was or why she was there.Meantime at ten o\\'clock Mary Dunlap and Mrs. Sheldon arrived in the\\r\\ncity, and took their way briskly, attended by a porter carrying their\\r\\nluggage, straight through the tiled tunnel and into the Pennsylvania\\r\\nHotel, where they were given a room one floor below where Marguerite\\r\\nslept her exhausted sleep.\"We had better not wait for anything,\" said Marguerite\\'s mother\\r\\nanxiously, giving a push and a pat to the straggling locks about her\\r\\ntemples and walking nervously toward the door.\"My dear, you are going to have a cup of coffee before we stir a step,\"\\r\\nsaid Mary Dunlap firmly. \"I told the boy as we came up in the elevator\\r\\nto have it sent up at once and it\\'s not going to take three minutes\\r\\nto drink it. I tell you nothing is doing in New York until ten, and\\r\\nshe can\\'t get away right at once. There is no use running risks. You\\r\\nare going on your nerve, and that might give out at the wrong time and\\r\\nspoil everything. There, he is knocking now. Sit down and drink it.\\r\\nThen we\\'ll call a taxi and be there in no time! It is quite early yet\\r\\nand I\\'m positive Mr. Oliver—I mean Keller—never goes down to his office\\r\\nbefore half past ten at the earliest.\"But Nelson Whitney had not been able to sleep. He had laid himself\\r\\nproperly in bed of course and closed his eyes. He had committed himself\\r\\nand his wishes and his girl to the care of One who was infinitely\\r\\npowerful, infinitely able, infinitely willing to bring order out of\\r\\nconfusion, and he was resting on that; but he lay there staring into\\r\\nthe night and facing a thing that might be coming to him on the morrow.\\r\\nSupposing he should find that Marguerite had already gone to that other\\r\\nman, and that, unworthy though he believed him to be, she was now\\r\\nirrevocably committed to him, for better, for worse. Could he give up\\r\\nhis will in the matter, his joy, his very life, and give up his girl to\\r\\na sorrow he felt was inevitable if she married Keller?Whitney did not oversleep. He arose far earlier than he had set himself\\r\\nto be about. He tried to eat some breakfast, but it was as dust and\\r\\nashes in his mouth. He went out to walk, but the exercise was merely\\r\\nmechanical. He did not see the buildings he passed, nor notice anybody\\r\\non the street. He was going over the probable program for the morning,\\r\\ntrying to decide which thing he should do first.If he went to the train to meet Mrs. Sheldon, he would be late in\\r\\ngetting to Fifth Avenue when Marguerite would be likely to be arriving.\\r\\nIf he went to Fifth Avenue first, he would be too late to meet the\\r\\ntrain. He finally decided that it was more important to find Marguerite\\r\\nthan her mother, for the mother would communicate with Mary at home as\\r\\nsoon as she located in a hotel and if he found Marguerite, he could\\r\\ntelephone to Mary and have little trouble in locating Mrs. Sheldon\\r\\nafterward. Marguerite was of course the first consideration.He had no trouble in finding the number on the avenue that had been\\r\\nindicated in Marguerite\\'s note, and was somewhat reassured, but also\\r\\nnot a little troubled to find the name, \"R. H. Oliver, Manager,\" in\\r\\ngold letters on the rich glass of the heavy mahogany door. Just what\\r\\neffect would it have upon the girl who had taken this wild midnight\\r\\njourney to prove there was no such person? He pondered this as he\\r\\nsought out the janitor and asked a few questions about the usual hour\\r\\nof opening the offices in that building.He was still pondering it as he set out to walk a regular beat, up the\\r\\navenue, across the street, down the avenue, across and back again,\\r\\nvarying it occasionally by a quick detour into one of the side streets\\r\\nwhere he turned about and returned the other way. He did not care to\\r\\nbe noticed, as he kept his anxious vigil. As the minutes passed into\\r\\nan hour and then dropped into long minutes again, his heart sank with\\r\\nthe fear lest after all somehow he had missed her. Perhaps she had come\\r\\ndown to the office building ahead of him, or perhaps she had looked up\\r\\nthe name in the city directory, discovered that it really was there,\\r\\nand had changed her course. Why had he not thought of that before? Yet\\r\\nwhat else could he have done than he had done? He had no clue but this,\\r\\nand must follow it to its reasonable end.There were not many people on that part of the avenue so early, and\\r\\nhe had no difficulty in getting a good look at each one. He felt\\r\\nreasonably certain that she could not have got by since he had arrived,\\r\\nso he tramped back and forth like a lion in a cage, not daring to go\\r\\nbeyond the bounds he had set himself lest somehow she escape him. The\\r\\nthought that was aching into his heart now was what possible connection\\r\\ncould there be between this man Oliver and the fellow Keller whom his\\r\\ngirl had declared her intention of marrying after she had proved that\\r\\nthere was no such person as Oliver?A dim possibility was stealing through his mental turbulence, but\\r\\nhe rejected such an explanation of the situation, as unworthy of a\\r\\ndecent man to think about another, even about one whom he distrusted.\\r\\nYet again and again it recurred. Had someone been trying to make his\\r\\nlittle girl see that the man with whom she seemed to be infatuated was\\r\\nunworthy of her? Had she set out to disprove what they had told her? It\\r\\nmust be something of that sort of course, but what?By the time that he had tramped nearly two hours away in anxious\\r\\nwatching, he was in a mood to wish he could get his hands on this\\r\\nKeller man and give him a good thrashing. He felt more and more\\r\\nconfident that he deserved it, even though he might be none of the\\r\\nunworthy kinds of villain that his imagination had been conjuring.It was still five minutes to the hour the janitor had mentioned as\\r\\nopening time for offices when he finally tramped back to the building\\r\\nand entered the elevator. He had considered staying outside in the\\r\\nstreet till he saw Marguerite arrive, but rejected the idea as futile.\\r\\nShe would be very likely to see him if he came too near, and perhaps\\r\\nevade him, for it was most likely that she wanted none of her friends\\r\\nwith her on this expedition, else she would surely have confided in her\\r\\nmother.He had considered also secreting himself somewhere in the hallway, at a\\r\\ngood vantage point to watch for her, if there were such a hiding place,\\r\\nbut rejected that idea also, because if anything was going to happen,\\r\\nhe wanted to be there to see what it was. He felt that it was his right\\r\\nto understand the case, seeing he was going to try to help Marguerite.\\r\\nHow else could he know whether or not he might be intruding where even\\r\\nangels should not tread? No, he must be in the office, and well placed\\r\\nwhere she would not notice him, or he might never find out whether\\r\\nhe even had a right to try to help her. He must fathom this mystery\\r\\nhimself. It was not anything Marguerite\\'s mother could tell him, else\\r\\nhe felt sure she would have called for him in the middle of the night\\r\\neven, to accompany her and help her in her trouble. That it was a\\r\\nterrible trouble to the mother he had no doubt.He had a bad half minute when several young women came hurriedly into\\r\\nthe hall and rushed for the elevator. Perhaps she was among them, and\\r\\nthis would be by no means the place he had planned to meet Marguerite,\\r\\nin the elevator!But the young women were none of them the girl he sought; they were\\r\\nobviously secretaries hastening to their various jobs, and he drew an\\r\\ninvoluntary breath of relief as the elevator shot up to the floor to\\r\\nwhich he was going. The young women all got out at different stops by\\r\\nthe way.He was glad that he was the only one in the elevator when it stopped at\\r\\nthe ninth floor, and he could get off and take his bearings once more\\r\\nwithout observation. Then he noticed that the door of R. H. Oliver\\'s\\r\\noffice was standing ajar, and with quickened pulse he hurried down the\\r\\nhall.NELSON WHITNEY pushed the door of R. H. Oliver\\'s office open quickly\\r\\nand stepped within with an air of stealthy triumph. He looked around\\r\\nfurtively with keen eyes, half fearful at what he might see.But there was no one there but an elderly girl taking off her hat and\\r\\ncoat at the back of the room. She hung them on a couple of pegs in a\\r\\nshadowy corner, patted her hair into prim shape before a small mirror,\\r\\nand put a last dab of powder on a thin angular nose. He paused and\\r\\nwatched her uncertainly.\"Is Mr. Oliver in yet?\" he asked as she turned inquiringly and came\\r\\ntoward him, her folded gloves and a large flat purse in her hand.\"Oh, no!\" she said with a tang of amusement in her voice that set him\\r\\ndown for a country ninny. She glanced at the clock. \"He never gets down\\r\\nbefore half past if he does then.\"Whitney cast a quick searching gaze around the room once more, as if\\r\\nperchance the girl he sought might be hiding somewhere in the shadows.\"Mind if I wait here?\" he asked, ignoring the contempt in the girl\\'s\\r\\nvoice.\"Help yourself,\" said the girl in a chilly tone.She unlocked the desk, and slung a typewriter out into the open from\\r\\nsome hidden recess, laid her pocketbook and gloves in a drawer, took\\r\\nout a dust cloth and proceeded to polish her desk and clean her\\r\\ntypewriter. She had the appearance of not even remembering that the\\r\\nyoung man existed. Presently she began to hum a jazzy little radio tune\\r\\nto further shut him out of her immediate circle.This just suited Whitney. He deliberately took in every corner of the\\r\\nroom, the beautiful furniture and the rich Oriental rug, and selected\\r\\na shadowy alcove behind the main door, facing toward the windows on\\r\\nthe other side of the room. It was a dark little corner, gloomy in\\r\\nfact, the alcove being formed by the ground glass partition of an inner\\r\\noffice that ran out from the main wall ten feet and then down to the\\r\\nback of the room. The angle of these walls would partly hide him, even\\r\\nfrom the girl at her desk which stood well out in the middle of the\\r\\nroom. The gloom of the corner would not call attention to his presence.He drew a carved walnut chair into the right position to give him a\\r\\nview of the room and yet not bring him into notice and sat down. After\\r\\na calm minute or two, he unfurled a morning paper which he could not\\r\\npossibly have read to advantage in the dim light, and prepared to hide\\r\\nbehind it at the approach of footsteps. Surely he ought to be able to\\r\\nremain incognito here, for a while at least till matters developed,\\r\\nseeing that none of the people who were likely to have a part in the\\r\\nlittle drama about to be played had the slightest idea that he was in\\r\\nthat part of the country. They would scarcely recognize his shoes and\\r\\ntrousers, nor his hands, and that was all that the paper and the gloom\\r\\nwould reveal. He would just sit quietly here and see what happened.The secretary finished her morning cleaning and began typing some\\r\\nletters. The minutes ticked slowly by on the magnificent mahogany\\r\\ngrandfather clock that stood six feet against the opposite wall between\\r\\nthe two high windows. Nelson Whitney began to tell himself that he was\\r\\na fool, and had come on a fool\\'s errand. Probably nobody would come at\\r\\nall that he expected. Probably the morning would go by, and the man\\r\\nOliver would arrive and he wouldn\\'t even know him from any other man,\\r\\nlet alone knowing what to say to him.For the next five minutes he busied himself planning what errand he\\r\\nmight possibly have for visiting an unknown man in his office. A\\r\\nperusal of the ground glass door into the hall did not help him. It\\r\\nbore over Oliver\\'s name the legend \"Ransom, Oliver, Bates and Company\"\\r\\nnothing more. He did not know whether they sold bonds or automobiles\\r\\nor insurance. They might be almost anything. There wasn\\'t a scratch of\\r\\nanything in the room that he could see that would give the slightest\\r\\nclue. There was nothing on the wall within his vision but a framed\\r\\netching of old New York.What should he do? Should he say he was waiting for friends who were\\r\\nto meet him there? Should he tell the man when he arrived that he must\\r\\nhave come to the wrong address? It seemed that he would appear a fool\\r\\nin almost anything he might say, yet he held his ground and sat behind\\r\\nhis paper trying to frame a reasonable excuse for his presence. He\\r\\ndecided that he might perhaps ask if the man wanted to employ a helper.\\r\\nThere was Jack Rector at home who was crazy to get a job in New York.\\r\\nYet what kind of a job would this be? Something that could be sold?\\r\\nJack would make a keen young salesman.The minutes dragged on. The secretary typed incessantly and paid no\\r\\nmore attention to him than if he had been an empty chair. The room was\\r\\nas still as an empty cell, sealed from the roar and rumble of the city\\r\\nnoises.Nelson Whitney was still pondering possibilities when there came at\\r\\nlast the clang of an elevator, and steps, leisurely steps, outside the\\r\\ndoor. His heart stood still and then leaped forward in great bounds for\\r\\nit was a woman\\'s step. Had the moment arrived at last? And if his girl\\r\\nshould see him, how would she take it? Would she think he, too, was in\\r\\nleague against her and be angry? He withdrew still further into the\\r\\ndepths of his paper, and the door swung open and admitted a lady.The secretary jumped up, all smiles.\"Oh, good morning Mrs. Oliver! Aren\\'t you downtown early? Didn\\'t Mr.\\r\\nOliver come with you? I thought he was expecting to be in the office\\r\\nthis morning. There are some checks for him to sign.\"Whitney lowered his paper and saw a woman about forty years old, a\\r\\nsweet-faced woman with a lovely smile, and faultlessly dressed.\"Good morning, Miss Flinch,\" she said pleasantly. \"Why, no, Mr. Oliver\\r\\nand Katharine came down earlier. Hasn\\'t he come yet? He said he would\\r\\nsurely be here by this time. I expected to find him in his office hard\\r\\nat work, or else ready to chide me for being ten minutes later than I\\r\\npromised. I was waiting for Gloria. She was to drive back with the car\\r\\nand get me, but she telephoned that they had a flat tire, and she would\\r\\nmeet me here. Hasn\\'t she come yet either?\"\"No, Mrs. Oliver. But I guess they\\'ll be here presently,\" assured the\\r\\nsecretary.\"Of course,\" said the lady. \"Well, I\\'ll just step into Mr. Oliver\\'s\\r\\noffice and write a note. I was afraid I wouldn\\'t have time to write it\\r\\nat home, but it really ought to go.\"The secretary smiled and the lady retreated through the ground glass\\r\\ndoor of the inner office. The typewriter clicked on.The clang of the elevator was becoming more frequent now, and there\\r\\nwere more and more footsteps going down the marble corridor. Whitney\\r\\nscarcely realized that the hall door had opened again until he heard a\\r\\nwoman\\'s clear voice speaking to the secretary.\"Has Mr. Oliver come in yet?\"\"No,\" said the secretary severely.\"How soon do you expect him?\"\"Almost any time now,\" said his keeper ungraciously. \"Did you have an\\r\\nappointment?\"\"No,\" said the woman, \"but he knows me well.\"\"He\\'s very busy this morning,\" interrupted the secretary. \"He\\'s been\\r\\naway for three weeks and there are a lot of things for him to attend\\r\\nto. I don\\'t know if he\\'ll have time to see anybody,\" and she cast a\\r\\nbelligerent look toward the newspaper and the legs over in the gloomy\\r\\nalcove.\"Don\\'t worry,\" said the dominant voice of Mrs. Dunlap pleasantly, \"I\\r\\nshall not keep him a second. I merely want him to endorse a check for\\r\\nme. I\\'m a personal friend. I\\'ll just wait till he comes.\"The secretary looked as if she thought that was a doubtful statement,\\r\\nbut she assented silently and went on typing.Whitney wondered what there was about that voice that reminded him of\\r\\nsomething recent? He lowered his paper and shot a glance at the woman\\r\\nand then he saw there was another with her, a quiet, shrinking woman\\r\\nwith gray hair, and a sweet profile that he had known all his life. And\\r\\nthe other one was the woman that had been calling on Mrs. Sheldon when\\r\\nhe went to see Marguerite!Well, at least he would not have to search for them. They were here.\\r\\nNow, what should he do? Reveal himself to them at once and try to\\r\\nmake some plan? But no—there were more footsteps coming that way,\\r\\nand the clang of the elevator continually now. It would not do to be\\r\\ncaught saying good morning to them if Marguerite should walk in. And\\r\\nbesides—just what should he say how explain his presence there? Should\\r\\nhe confess that he had read a letter that was not intended for his\\r\\neyes? Strange he had not remembered to think that all out and have some\\r\\nplan. He had had all night to plan it and he had not done it.The two women had stood hesitating a moment by the desk, but Mrs.\\r\\nDunlap went into action as Whitney stole a glance over his paper.\"Let\\'s sit over here by the window,\" she said in a tone as if she were\\r\\nquite at home.She went to the corner she had indicated and whirled the chairs about\\r\\nso that they would face away from the room, and put their occupants\\r\\nwith their backs toward anyone entering. But Mrs. Sheldon did not\\r\\nfollow immediately. She lingered hesitantly by the desk an instant\\r\\nlonger, a worried wistful look in her sweet eyes.\"My—daughter—hasn\\'t come in yet, has she?\" she hazarded. \"She was\\r\\nto—that is, she was expecting—I mean we expected to meet her here.\"She glanced apologetically toward her companion, and then back\\r\\nwistfully to the secretary.\"Nobody been in this morning but that man,\" said the secretary still\\r\\nungraciously, indicating with a sweep of her capable white hand the\\r\\nlegs in the alcove surmounted by the newspaper.Daisy\\'s mother gave a quick frightened glance toward the alcove without\\r\\nrealizing that those legs had often been a familiar sight in her house.\\r\\nShe retreated half frightened to the chair Mrs. Dunlap smilingly\\r\\noffered, and the two women sank down quietly with two magazines that\\r\\nMrs. Dunlap produced from the window seat. Again the click of the\\r\\ntypewriter was the only sound that was heard.The postman came in presently and left a great stack of mail which gave\\r\\nthe secretary a rest from her typing while she went resolutely through\\r\\nthe letters, sorting them into piles.There were many footsteps going down the corridor now, and the three\\r\\nwhose hearts were listening for a certain step, could not be certain at\\r\\nall. The mother started nervously whenever any one approached the door.The elevator was clanging incessantly. Presently a nervous step came\\r\\ndown the corridor, almost breathlessly, as if the owner had hurried,\\r\\nthen hesitated a moment in front of the door. The knob turned, slowly,\\r\\nalmost timidly.Somehow Whitney knew that step—knew in his heart that she had come\\r\\nat last, and felt the horror that would be in her white face as she\\r\\ndiscovered the name she had come to disprove shining golden in the\\r\\nnoonday light. The paper in his hand trembled and he dared to peer\\r\\naround it at the little white frightened, almost belligerent face of\\r\\nthe girl he loved.She stood in the doorway for an instant and swept the room with her\\r\\nglance, not carefully for she was too nervous, and she was not looking\\r\\nfor people from home. Whitney was at one side, almost behind her now,\\r\\nfor she was standing in the middle of the room wide-eyed, and she had\\r\\nscarcely noticed the backs of the two women shrinking into their chairs\\r\\nin the window corner earnestly reading magazines.She went straight up to the desk and her voice trembled a little as she\\r\\nasked her questions.\"Is this Mr. R. H. Oliver\\'s office?\"Miss Flinch surveyed her impersonally before she nodded.\"May I see him at once?\" asked Marguerite, growing more certain of\\r\\nherself now, and speaking excitedly.\"He isn\\'t here yet.\"\"Not here?\" the little catch in Marguerite\\'s voice could be heard\\r\\naround the room. \"How soon will he be in? I\\'ve got to catch a Western\\r\\ntrain and there\\'s only three quarters of an hour.\"\"I can\\'t say when he\\'ll be in,\" said the secretary regarding her\\r\\nindifferently. \"It might be in five minutes, it might be half an hour.\"\"But you\\'re sure he is coming? This morning?\"\"Positive,\" said the laconic secretary. \"His wife\\'s in the private\\r\\noffice waiting for him now. There\\'s all these people waiting to see\\r\\nhim, and he\\'s awfully busy besides. He\\'s got to sign a lot of letters\\r\\nand meet two men at one o\\'clock, and he\\'s taking his wife and children\\r\\noff for a holiday. If that isn\\'t a full day, I don\\'t know where you\\r\\ncome in. But you can sit down and wait if you think there\\'s any chance\\r\\nfor you.\"\"Oh, I won\\'t keep him but an instant. If I can just see him!\"The secretary waved her to a chair.\"You\\'ll have to take your turn,\" she warned her.Marguerite cast a swift appraising glance around the room, at the two\\r\\nhuddled figures in the chairs by the window, two oldish backs upon whom\\r\\nher glance scarcely rested and a pair of gentlemanly legs surmounted by\\r\\na newspaper. Strangers in a land that was strange to her, what could\\r\\nthey mean to her but hindrances to her completed race? It was hours\\r\\nlater than she had meant to be, and she ought to get out of New York,\\r\\nand away to seek her beloved.She knew that her mother would presently stir up something. She was not\\r\\na woman to lie idly by and see her only daughter lost in the world,\\r\\nwith an undesirable marriage in the offing. She would presently set\\r\\nsomething going somehow to hinder. Her mother was never balked when\\r\\nthe welfare of one beloved was concerned. She simply must get a train\\r\\nright away as soon as she had seen this man. Of course he would not be\\r\\nthe right one. Of course that lying Mrs. Dunlap had merely given the\\r\\nname of some one she knew as a bluff to gain her point. And as soon as\\r\\nshe laid eyes on the man and saw he was not anyone she had ever seen\\r\\nbefore, she would apologize pleasantly, say she must have the wrong\\r\\naddress, and depart.While she was dressing she had remembered a way to find Rufus. She\\r\\nwould get that minister friend of his that was to have married them, on\\r\\nthe long distance telephone, and find out how best to reach him. The\\r\\nrest would be easy of course. Then she would get away from New York as\\r\\nfast as possible, somewhere, anywhere, it didn\\'t matter much, just a\\r\\nlittle way, so she could not be traced, and then get off and telephone\\r\\nRufus. She would plan to meet him wherever he said and be married at\\r\\nonce. Perhaps she might even suggest this to the minister friend of\\r\\nhis when she found the address, just say they were going to be married\\r\\nat once, that all difficulties had been cleared away or something like\\r\\nthat.How fortunate it was that she remembered the name and address of that\\r\\nminister so well. She had watched Rufus writing out the telegram as he\\r\\nargued, and he had written Rev. Lee Spencer, D.D. so beautifully. He\\r\\nhad a wonderful, bold way of writing that thrilled her to watch, it\\r\\nseemed so masterful!All these thoughts went racing through Marguerite\\'s mind as she dropped\\r\\ninto a chair near the desk facing the entrance, her eyes glued to the\\r\\ndoor that she might get the first glimpse of the man as he entered.Mrs. Dunlap half leaned over toward Mrs. Sheldon to whisper, and then\\r\\nthought better of it. They exchanged lifted eyebrows, and a question\\r\\nstood in their eyes for an instant. Then suddenly a quick eager young\\r\\nstep came rushing down the corridor. The door opened with a rush and\\r\\nclosed with a bang as a slim pretty girl entered panting as if she had\\r\\nrun up several flights of stairs.\"Oh, Miss Flinch,\" she gasped, \"has Daddy come yet? I\\'ve simply ruined\\r\\nmyself running up all the stairs. I couldn\\'t wait for the elevator. I\\r\\nwas afraid Dad and Mother wouldn\\'t wait for me. Oh hasn\\'t he come yet?\\r\\nOh, I\\'m glad! But Muth is here isn\\'t she? I thought she would be. I\\r\\ntelephoned her I had a flat tire, and I had to leave the tiresome old\\r\\ncar in a garage away uptown, and walk three blocks to get a bus, and\\r\\nthen it didn\\'t come forever and an age. The bus service in this town is\\r\\nthe limit isn\\'t it? Did you say Muth was here?\"\"Yes, Miss Gloria, she came half an hour ago. She\\'s in your father\\'s\\r\\noffice writing a letter.\"\"Oh, I know. She said it simply had to go or she couldn\\'t go with\\r\\nus. You know, Miss Flinch, it\\'s her birthday, and Daddy came home\\r\\nespecially for it. We\\'re going off on a spree. Daddy won\\'t tell us\\r\\nwhere, but we\\'re going in the new car, and it\\'s to be a surprise party\\r\\nfor us all. Muth doesn\\'t even know which way we are taking.\"But I can\\'t think what\\'s keeping Daddy and Katharine. You know, Miss\\r\\nFlinch,\" Gloria lowered her voice with a glance toward the ground glass\\r\\npartition, \"they\\'ve gone to get her present. She doesn\\'t know a thing\\r\\nabout it of course. Katharine picked it out weeks ago and she and I\\r\\nhad it put away till Daddy would get back. We knew he\\'d love it for\\r\\nher, and I know it\\'s just what she wants. It\\'s a platinum wristwatch\\r\\nand bracelet with diamonds and sapphires all set around the edge. Oh,\\r\\nit\\'s perfectly darling. She\\'ll show it to you of course. But I\\'m just\\r\\ndying to see what she says when he gives it to her. Oh, dear! Why don\\'t\\r\\nthey come? I do hope there isn\\'t some stupid old mistake. Perhaps some\\r\\ndumbbell of a salesman has sold it to someone else. Wouldn\\'t that\\r\\nsimply be unbearable? Perhaps they\\'ve had to hunt around for another.\\r\\nBut I never saw any as precious as this one.\"\"I wouldn\\'t worry, Miss Gloria,\" said the secretary fondly. \"They\\'ve\\r\\nlikely been delayed in traffic. There! There\\'s the elevator! Maybe\\r\\nthey\\'re coming now. Yes, I think that\\'s Mr. Oliver\\'s step.\"\"Oh, it is, it is! The day is saved,\" cried Gloria tragically.The door opened and another very pretty girl scarcely older than the\\r\\nfirst entered, and behind her a gentleman.\"There! Daddy! You\\'re late yourself. I\\'ve won the bet and you\\'ve got\\r\\nto pay up! A five-pound box of chocolates! Remember! You promised! And\\r\\na new pair of slippers for the party! Muth and I\\'ve been here a long\\r\\ntime—and I had a flat tire, too, and a lot of trouble.\"The gentleman stepped in and closed the door, gave a quick glance at\\r\\nthe legs and the newspaper in the alcove, another toward the window\\r\\nwhere huddled the two women, and then faced toward the desk where\\r\\nfor the instant his two daughters had so grouped themselves as to\\r\\ncompletely hide the white-faced girl from his vision.Gloria boomed forth again:\"Now, Daddy, you\\'ve simply got to come into the office and show it to\\r\\nher at once. I can\\'t wait another second. I\\'m dying to see what she\\r\\nthinks of it. Come on in now before Miss Flinch gets you into a lot of\\r\\ntiresome checks and letters you have to sign. Come on, Daddy it won\\'t\\r\\ntake long, and then Muth can enjoy it while she waits.\"Gloria caught his hands and pulled him toward the door of the inner\\r\\noffice, and Katharine moved to follow, when suddenly the man saw the\\r\\nwhite-faced girl. She had risen from her seat, and exclaimed eagerly,\\r\\npleadingly, as if somehow the sight of her eyes, the hearing of her\\r\\nears had deceived her, and this was some horrible dream which would\\r\\npresently be explained:\"Rufus! Oh Rufus—I\\'ve come—!\"The man turned ashen color, and looked as if he were going to drop.\\r\\nHe stopped where he stood, apparently unable to move further, feebly\\r\\ndrawing his hands away from the eager girls who kept trying to draw him\\r\\non.\"Go! Go!\" he said to them in a voice that sounded more like a croak.\\r\\n\"Go to your mother! I\\'ll come in a moment!\"There was something in his voice that made the girls obey, though\\r\\nreluctantly.\"What is the matter now?\" murmured Gloria, impatiently. \"Didn\\'t you get\\r\\nit? Didn\\'t he like it, Kath?\"\"Yes, and he\\'s crazy about it. I\\'m sure I don\\'t know what\\'s the matter.\\r\\nSome tiresome old business probably. It\\'s always that way.\"As the inner door closed on them, Gloria\\'s perplexed voice asked:\"What did that girl mean \\'Rufus\\'?\"IT WAS Mrs. Dunlap who took command of the situation, stepping into the\\r\\npicture at exactly the most awful moment of revelation when several\\r\\nlives seemed about to fall into chaos.\"Oh, Mr. Oliver,\" she said in her pleasant, commanding tone coming\\r\\nforward with a fountain pen and a bit of blue paper in her hand, until\\r\\nshe stood exactly before the shrinking girl, and the ghastly man, \"Good\\r\\nmorning! I won\\'t detain you but an instant. I just stepped in to ask\\r\\nif you would kindly endorse this check for me so that I can cash it. I\\r\\nfound myself suddenly out of money, and near your office, and I knew\\r\\nyou would help me out.\"She held out the check and pen, and the desperate man reached for\\r\\nthem as a drowning man would reach for a rope flung out to him. He\\r\\neven tried to summon a smile of graciousness to his stiff lips, and\\r\\nnaturalness to his voice as he assented:\"Why, certainly, Mrs. Dunlap—I\\'m—delighted to be able to do anything\\r\\nfor you.\"There was a high-strained quality to his voice and his attempt at a\\r\\nlaugh was a decided failure. His hand was shaking, as he wrote his\\r\\nname, Ralph H. Oliver across the back of the check. It was an old\\r\\nblank one which Mrs. Dunlap had carried with her in her purse for\\r\\nseveral months in case of emergency. That morning she had made it out\\r\\nto herself, signed with her maiden name and endorsed it. But the man\\r\\nwho endorsed it again was not even noticing whether it was a check\\r\\nor not. He was only bestirring his clever brain to get him out of\\r\\nthis situation, and by the time the name was written, he had made his\\r\\ndecision. He would ignore this girl, and get himself out of the room at\\r\\nonce, and out of the building, even if he was obliged to emerge through\\r\\nthe tenth-story window to the street. Anything no matter how ghastly,\\r\\nwas better than what would probably happen if he remained.He swung himself around to face Mrs. Dunlap, and put Marguerite out of\\r\\nrange, as he handed over the check with a hand that was shaking visibly.Again the stiffening lips wrinkled themselves into a ghastly semblance\\r\\nof a smile as he spoke, his manner an attempt at the debonair:\"Mrs. Dunlap, I think my wife is in my private office, and she will\\r\\nnever forgive me if I do not call her. She will want to see you if only\\r\\nfor a moment. Let me go and call her.\"\"Oh, I\\'ll call her, Mr. Oliver!\" said the secretary eagerly, half\\r\\nrising from her desk.\"No, no, Miss Flinch. I\\'ll call her myself. I want you to get those\\r\\nletters out before the next mail please. It is very imperative. I\\'ll\\r\\njust call her.\"\"Indeed, Mr. Oliver, I cannot possibly wait a moment,\" interrupted\\r\\nMrs. Dunlap. \"Tell Mrs. Oliver for me that I am returning this way in\\r\\na week or two and I will call her up and make an appointment to see\\r\\nher. But now I really must hasten away. I have friends here with me\\r\\nwho are in haste. By the way, of course you know them.\" She stepped\\r\\nback and turned toward Mrs. Sheldon who had risen and come forward,\\r\\nher eyes stern, her face full of indignation and dislike. \"My friend\\r\\nMrs. Sheldon. I think you have already met in her home town and Miss\\r\\nSheldon, her daughter? And now we mustn\\'t keep you an instant.\"Nelson Whitney had long ago discarded the enveloping newspaper and\\r\\nwas on his feet, standing in the shadow of the alcove, with eyes only\\r\\nfor the white-faced girl. When the others stepped before her and hid\\r\\nhis vision, he came forward into the light, forgetting that he did\\r\\nnot intend to reveal his identity just now, forgetting everything but\\r\\nthat the beloved eyes were filled with sudden awful comprehension, and\\r\\nagony, the beloved lips were trembling visibly, and his darling looked\\r\\nlike a white lily stricken and about to fall.Sudden revelation had made him, too, wise as to the situation; for\\r\\nwhen Mr. Ralph Oliver turned to hand Mrs. Dunlap the endorsed check,\\r\\nthe light from the windows fell full upon his ashen face, and Whitney\\r\\nrecognized him at once as Rufus Keller, and the whole dastardly truth\\r\\nburst upon him. For an instant his desire to take the scoundrel by\\r\\nthe collar and thrash him, or fling him from the room almost overcame\\r\\nhim, as he took another step forward; and then suddenly a new element\\r\\nentered the scene in the appearance of the two girls and their mother\\r\\nfrom the inner office!A wave of utter fear that passed over the face of Oliver, gave Whitney\\r\\nquick comprehension once more, and he saw suddenly what sorrow it would\\r\\nmean to these other innocent ones, as well as to his dear girl, if\\r\\nfurther revelations were made at that moment. Not for a second would\\r\\nhe have hesitated for the sake of the villain, for he deserved every\\r\\ninch of punishment that was coming to him; but even in this crisis, it\\r\\ncame to Nelson Whitney like a flash that there was one who had said,\\r\\n\"Vengeance is Mine!\"Who was he to judge this cringing soul, and bring sorrow to these\\r\\ntrusting other ones? Therefore he stopped where he stood, just behind\\r\\nthe man who had done his best to shatter the joy of at least four\\r\\nlives, and waited. He was not even aware that he had come out of his\\r\\nhiding, or that his presence would presently need explanation. He just\\r\\nstood there as if he had been called to place by some higher power than\\r\\nhimself, ready for the moment when he would be needed.Oliver was a clever man, a cunning actor, else he could not so long\\r\\nhave deceived those who loved him. He was quick to clutch again at the\\r\\nslender rope thrown out to him. With a suave distant manner, not too\\r\\ngracious, he acknowledged the introduction, standing where he was, and\\r\\ngiving them but a polite lifting of the eyelids that swept them both in\\r\\na cold distant glance:\"I believe we have met before—Winfield, was it? Or one of those little\\r\\ntowns out that way? I am traveling so much and meeting so many—\"Nelson Whitney marveled at the colossal assurance that could speak such\\r\\nwords so coolly, and then his attention was suddenly drawn to Mrs.\\r\\nSheldon. She had drawn her sweet patrician dignity up about her as a\\r\\ngarment, and seemed to stand fully two inches taller than her usual\\r\\nheight, as she looked straight into the eyes of the man who had tried\\r\\nto deceive her only daughter. There was an instant\\'s pause, as if her\\r\\neyes could say to him all that her lips had been forbidden for the sake\\r\\nof others to do, and then her voice broke into clear contempt as she\\r\\nsaid:\"And our friend Mr. Whitney, Nelson Whitney of Wellsburgh! I think you\\r\\nhave met him also, Mr.—Oliver?\"It was a masterly stroke, and conveyed to the wretched man all that a\\r\\nwoman of Mrs. Sheldon\\'s birth and breeding could never have said in\\r\\nwords.Oliver wheeled and faced Whitney, a look of genuine fright in his eyes.\\r\\nJust a flash, and then he turned quickly back and waved toward the\\r\\nthree who were advancing eagerly from the office door:\"Here comes my wife now, and my daughters. I knew they would be\\r\\ndelighted to see you. Mrs. Dunlap, will you do the honors and excuse me\\r\\njust a moment? There is a telegram I must send at once!\" he glanced at\\r\\nhis watch. \"I had forgotten it.\"He turned furtively, and Nelson Whitney was reminded of his dog at home\\r\\nwho when he was reproved was in the habit of stealing from the room,\\r\\nhalf crouched, his tail between his legs, and stealthily looking back\\r\\nas he slithered out of the room.So Ralph Oliver slunk from the room into his inner office, and locked\\r\\nthe door. The keen ears of Mrs. Dunlap heard the grate of the key.Yet before he had fairly turned away from them, the room was thrilled\\r\\nwith a clear voice:\"We really ought all to go at once. Nelson and I have been planning to\\r\\nsee Grant\\'s Tomb and the Museum. Will you take me there now, Nelson?\"It was Marguerite, the old sweet challenge of her friendly voice\\r\\nstartling him into life once more. It was more than an appeal. It was\\r\\nas if she went back ten years to their childhood days when they had\\r\\nplanned to see all the wonders of the world together. It had been a\\r\\nlong time since she had appealed to him for anything, and his heart\\r\\nleaped high with joy. Take her to the Museum? Yes, take her to the\\r\\nworld\\'s end if she chose!He took two good steps and was beside her, drawing her arm within his,\\r\\nand so together they acknowledged the introduction to a scoundrel\\'s\\r\\nlovely wife and daughters, with which Mrs. Dunlap noisily and\\r\\nskillfully covered the retreat of the enemy, the victory completely\\r\\nin her own hands. There was even a lilt in her voice as she told Mrs.\\r\\nOliver what a dear woman Mrs. Sheldon was; although her heart was\\r\\naching with mother love as she saw the brave white anguish which the\\r\\nvictim was showing as she held up her head and stood her ground, her\\r\\nknees were shaking under her.Mrs. Sheldon took the hand of the other mother, and said with a warmth\\r\\nof feeling strangely keen for a mere acquaintance.\"I have wanted to meet you. I have heard such beautiful things about\\r\\nyou, and now I see that they are all justified.\"Nelson Whitney saw that the little gloved hand on his arm was\\r\\nfluttering as if in ague, and tenderly he laid a strong hand\\r\\npossessively over it, and took the burden of the conversation as the\\r\\nintroduction came their way, leaving nothing for his dear girl to do\\r\\nbut try to smile.That she did it bravely and well, and that the strangers did not\\r\\nsuspect her state of mind was shown by the comments of Gloria later,\\r\\nwhen, the telegrams all sent, the letters dictated, and the checks\\r\\nsigned, they started in the new car on their delayed holiday, several\\r\\nhours late by the new watch flashing on Mrs. Oliver\\'s beautiful wrist.\"Wasn\\'t that girl perfectly darling!\" she said to her sister. \"She has\\r\\na face like Muth\\'s cameo pin, and the way she looked at her sweetheart\\r\\nwas just too dear!\"\"How do you know he was her sweetheart? She may have a dozen others,\"\\r\\nsaid the wiser Katharine.\"No, I\\'m positive. Didn\\'t you see how he put his hand over hers right\\r\\nthere in the office before us? And she let him. She isn\\'t the kind of\\r\\ngirl that lets a man do things like that unless she\\'s engaged to him.\\r\\nMy! But his eyes were handsome. He looked down at her as if he just\\r\\ncould eat her. Well, I don\\'t blame him. She is sweet. She\\'s precious! I\\r\\nwish she lived where we could know her. I\\'ve got a crush on her myself,\\r\\nand I think he\\'s a humdinger. I\\'d like to be bridesmaid at the wedding!\"Said R. H. Oliver suddenly as he yanked his car out of swift collision\\r\\nwith a truck:\"Gloria, I wish you wouldn\\'t talk any more if you\\'ve got to converse\\r\\nlike a fool! For heaven\\'s sake stop it!\"Just what heaven had to do with her guileless chatter Gloria didn\\'t\\r\\nunderstand, but she knew when her father spoke in that tone it was\\r\\ntime to cease, so Gloria sat back and dreamed of a day when a knight\\r\\nsimilar to Nelson Whitney would come riding her way, and hold her own\\r\\nfluttering hand, and look into her thrilled eyes, and carry her off\\r\\ninto a world of loveliness.Nelson Whitney led his beloved out of that office just as soon as the\\r\\nlaw of politeness allowed.Just an instant, he had paused beside Mrs. Sheldon as he passed her.\"Is there any special time when you would like to have us meet you at\\r\\nthe hotel?\" he asked in an undertone.But it was Mrs. Dunlap who heard and who handed him a card upon which\\r\\nshe had been scribbling.\"Any time you like,\" she said in a tone for his ears alone. \"Mrs.\\r\\nSheldon needs to rest, and I\\'ll see that she does. Just ring up the\\r\\nroom when you get back and let us know the program. I\\'ll stay till you\\r\\nget back at least.\"He glanced at the card. On it was written the name of the hotel and\\r\\nthe number of their room. A fleeting smile went over his face. Here\\r\\nthose two good ladies had come straight to the same hotel where\\r\\nhe was. He had had no need to worry at all with such a Guide. Why\\r\\nhadn\\'t he remembered that God was able to work out things without his\\r\\ninterference, able to make the crooked places straight, and the dark\\r\\nthings plain in His own good time!WHEN Mrs. Sheldon had turned from speaking with Mrs. Oliver and her two\\r\\ncharming daughters, she looked around the office in dismay.\"Why, where is Marguerite?\" she asked with instant worry in her eyes.\\r\\n\"She hasn\\'t gone away?\" and there was in her voice that quality of\\r\\ndesperation which had made Mrs. Dunlap fear for her health more than\\r\\nonce in the hours they had spent together.She hastened to assure her.\"It\\'s all right, Mrs. Sheldon. She\\'s with Nelson Whitney. They\\'ve gone\\r\\noff together to do some sight seeing I think.\"\"But they don\\'t know where we are that is they won\\'t know how to find\\r\\nus. Nelson didn\\'t—that is Marguerite won\\'t—\" She stopped in confusion,\\r\\nrealizing that this would seem very strange talk to the onlooking\\r\\nOlivers about people who were supposed to be of the same party.But Mrs. Dunlap was equal to the occasion.\"It\\'s all right, my dear. I told them where we were going, wrote it\\r\\ndown for them so they wouldn\\'t make a mistake.\"With relief, the weary mother relaxed the drawn look of her face and\\r\\nturned to the Olivers graciously.\"I\\'m so glad to have met you,\" she said, and smiled sincerely.When they were gone Gloria turned to her mother.\"I didn\\'t like the way she spoke to you, Mums dear!\" she said. \"It was\\r\\nalmost as if she felt sorry for you somehow.\"\"What a queer idea!\" laughed her mother. \"I think she is a very\\r\\ncharming woman. In fact anybody Mrs. Dunlap sponsors usually is.\"\"Yourself included, Mums!\" laughed Gloria. \"Come on Muth, lets rout out\\r\\nDad and get started. We\\'re two hours behind schedule now. Kath, you\\r\\nought to have run things better than this!\" And laughing they went off\\r\\nto find the beloved husband and father.They found him standing by the window with the sash thrown up, wiping\\r\\nbeads of perspiration from his forehead, though the day was keen and\\r\\nclear.\"What\\'s the matter, dear? Is there any trouble about your business?\"\\r\\nasked Mrs. Oliver solicitously.\"I wasn\\'t feeling very well there for a minute!\" said the valiant\\r\\nhusband, mopping his cold brow once more. \"I felt a little dizzy!\\r\\nI guess I\\'ve been going it a little too hard lately. I suppose I\\'m\\r\\ngetting old.\"He paused for his loving family to refute this statement, but they only\\r\\nlaughed as if it were a good joke.\"I think I\\'ll have to cut out some of this traveling,\" he said slowly,\\r\\ntaking deep breaths between his words. He still wore a sort of whipped\\r\\nlook except to his family\\'s eyes.But at that they all shouted a joyous assent, \"Yes, Dad, that would be\\r\\ngreat! Then you\\'d be all ours and not belong to the world at large any\\r\\nmore,\" added Gloria as the hurrah subsided.\"Come on, let\\'s go!\" said Oliver turning away from them quickly to hide\\r\\na look of something like shame that stole over his scared white face.\"But we haven\\'t given Muth her presents yet,\" reminded Gloria who never\\r\\nby any chance forgot anything.It was with relief that Oliver took the little white box containing the\\r\\nwatch from his pocket. The attention all focused upon it, instead of\\r\\nhimself, he was able even to make a pleasant little flowery speech in\\r\\npresentation.Nevertheless the occasion had ceased to be the joyous celebration that\\r\\nhe had anticipated. Half of his mind was necessarily occupied with\\r\\nwondering what on earth that Dunlap woman meant to do next? Did she\\r\\nintend to keep that miserable affair of Daisy hanging over his head\\r\\nlike a Damoclean sword the rest of his natural life? If so, there would\\r\\nbe no peace anywhere.He would never know when they might walk in and bring him to shame\\r\\namong his friends. Well, he had been a fool of course. It was hard to\\r\\nadmit it. Perhaps he had merely bungled things. But—yes, he felt a\\r\\ngood deal of a fool. After all, what was that girl but a pretty pink\\r\\nand white thing—just a passing fancy. Home was best. He would stay at\\r\\nhome—unless that obnoxious Mrs. Dunlap was going to haunt his steps.Perhaps it would be as well to go abroad for a year. The business\\r\\nwas in pretty good shape now, and the girls would love it. Yes, they\\r\\nwould go abroad. He would broach the subject that very day and hurry\\r\\nup arrangements to get away as soon as possible. He couldn\\'t stand any\\r\\nmore shocks like this one!Thus reasoning, he grew calm, and the family went down to the new car\\r\\nand their interrupted holiday.Down on the street Mrs. Sheldon looked about her in a dazed way and put\\r\\nher hand to her head. Her companion caught the gesture and slipped an\\r\\narm around her.\"My dear, you are going straight back to the hotel and take a good long\\r\\nsleep,\" she said, and raised her other hand to summon a passing taxi.\"Oh, I\\'m all right,\" murmured the little white-faced mother,\\r\\n\"Everything is all right now at least I hope it is, for a while.\\r\\nOnly—what shall I do with Daisy? Her life is broken! My poor little\\r\\nflower of a girl!\"\"Don\\'t you believe it!\" said the strong woman who knew life. \"God\\r\\ndoesn\\'t let even a flower get broken as easily as that. Here, let\\'s get\\r\\nin this taxi, and then we can talk.\"She gave the order to the driver, and then laid her hand on the\\r\\nstricken woman\\'s arm.\"My dear! You should be singing, shouting hallelujah, not mourning.\\r\\nCan\\'t you trust the Father who has brought about this revelation to\\r\\nshow your girl that life isn\\'t all gone just because she made a mistake\\r\\nabout one wolf in sheep\\'s clothing? This all came to your girl perhaps\\r\\nto teach her, and prepare her for a fuller, wider life than she could\\r\\nhave otherwise been prepared for.\"\"Oh!\" moaned the little mother, \"I wish I could feel that way, but it\\r\\nseems to me we have lost our self-respect. It seems as if Daisy has\\r\\nlost all the fine dignity and judgment she had, and that she can never\\r\\nlift up her head again.\"\"She has only lost her cock-suredness, my dear. She hasn\\'t lost a bit\\r\\nof self-respect. She has made a mistake, yes, and a bad one, but she\\r\\nwill learn to be more careful now, not to trust herself implicitly. She\\r\\nwill learn to pray her way through the difficulties, perhaps, instead\\r\\nof insisting she knows best and demanding her own way. She will pay\\r\\nmore heed to her mother\\'s advice to her mother\\'s intuition, and not\\r\\nconsider that her own discernment of character is final. You know we\\r\\nall have to have sharp lessons to teach us to find our guidance in the\\r\\nLord and our own utter helplessness without Him.\"\"But I\\'m so afraid Daisy won\\'t look at it that way. She is such an\\r\\nintense child, so proud and excitable, and enthusiastic, and so prone\\r\\nto go to the depths when the heights have failed her. I am afraid—Mrs.\\r\\nDunlap, forgive me, but I\\'m afraid she may lose her mind! You were not\\r\\nwith her that last night before she went away. You don\\'t realize.\"\"I realize that underneath are the Everlasting Arms, my dear,\" said\\r\\nMary Dunlap solemnly, \"and that the God who has just now performed\\r\\nthe seemingly impossible for you in convincing your daughter of the\\r\\nunworthiness of the man whom she was determined to marry, in time and\\r\\nbefore it was forever too late to save her from the public shame of her\\r\\nown actions, can perform like wonders in other ways. Now, dear sister,\\r\\nsuppose you just trust in Him. He has said, \\'Commit thy way unto the\\r\\nLord; trust also in Him and He shall bring it to pass.\\' Couldn\\'t you\\r\\njust rest on that this morning and let Him give you a good rest? I\\'m\\r\\nsure everything will be made plain for you. Now, here we are at the\\r\\nhotel.\"Mary Dunlap helped her friend up to her room for she looked as frail as\\r\\na lily by this time; and had a nice little lunch sent up of which she\\r\\nliterally forced her companion to partake.When she found the troubled mother did not wish to talk of other\\r\\nmatters she just went over the morning\\'s experience with her, bringing\\r\\nout at every turn, the wonders that the Lord had worked. She spoke of\\r\\nthe young man, Whitney.\"Tell me about him!\" she said as she poured a second cup of coffee.\\r\\n\"I\\'m wonderfully taken with that young man. He looks like true blue to\\r\\nme.\"\"Oh, he is!\" said Marguerite\\'s mother.And she began to tell of the days the years when her girl and this fine\\r\\nboy were growing up together, till gradually the care lifted from the\\r\\nmother\\'s face.But the tale came to a sudden bitter end with the plaint that was\\r\\nalmost a sob:\"She had all that devotion in a fine young man her own age, and yet she\\r\\ncould think she cared for that old slippery beast!\"Mary Dunlap gave an almost girlish giggle.\"He is that, isn\\'t he? I keep thinking of his poor dear wife and\\r\\ndaughters who think he is the salt of the earth. Oh, poor dears! I do\\r\\nhope they don\\'t ever have to find it out this side—or at least not till\\r\\nthe Lord has made him over. But my dear, don\\'t you think that perhaps\\r\\nyour child hadn\\'t just waked up to realities yet? Wasn\\'t she more in\\r\\nlove with being in love, than with the man himself? She was under a\\r\\nstrong delusion as the Bible says, but I\\'m sure it has been swept away,\\r\\nand in full time.\"My dear, I\\'ll tell you something. Her hand was on the boy\\'s arm\\r\\nconfidingly as if she trusted him, and his strong hand was over it,\\r\\ntenderly, comfortingly, as if she were dearer to him than life. I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t help seeing the look on his face as he bent to speak to her\\r\\nfrom his fine height—she is such a little girl, so sweet and small—and\\r\\nmy dear, I suppose I ought not to have seen it, and maybe ought to\\r\\nkeep it to myself now I have, but it seems to me you have a right to\\r\\nknow she smiled up into his face, such a sweet trustful smile, that I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t help feeling that her heart will fly back to him as a refuge\\r\\nnow in her trouble. I saw that. Yes, I saw it while you were talking to\\r\\nMrs. Oliver. I\\'m sure you have a right to know. And the Lord has let\\r\\nthat young man be an instrument of rescue for your girl. I\\'m sure.\"\"Oh!\" said the mother with a wistful sigh, \"If that could only be, I\\r\\nwould ask nothing better of life.\"\"Don\\'t set your limits, my dear! The Lord may have that and even\\r\\ngreater blessings yet in store. Now, you are going to sleep, and I\\'m\\r\\ngoing to sit here at the desk and get some of my correspondence out of\\r\\nthe way or I\\'ll be swamped.\"DOWN in the street Marguerite almost gave way.A glance at her face showed Nelson that she was almost at the limit of\\r\\nher strength. He summoned a taxi and put her in.\"Would you like to go to the hotel and lie down a while?\" he asked\\r\\ntenderly.\"Oh, no,\" she said shrinking toward him, \"I don\\'t want to be alone now.\\r\\nI can\\'t bear it. I must have someone who belongs. Let\\'s go to some\\r\\nquiet place where we can sit down a little while, or walk where there\\r\\nwon\\'t be so many people.\"She sank back in the seat and closed her eyes, and Whitney gave the\\r\\norder, \"Drive to the Park, and drive around till I tell you to stop.\"He got into the taxi, pulled down the shades, and drew her head gently\\r\\nover till it rested on his shoulder.\"Now,\" said he, \"just rest there a few minutes and get calm.\"There were hot tears running down her white cheeks.\"That\\'s all right, dear,\" he said as if he were talking to a little\\r\\nchild. \"Cry as hard as you can. It\\'ll do you good!\"There was a lilt in his voice. He was thinking how she had said she\\r\\nwanted to be with somebody who \"belonged.\" Then in her soul she felt\\r\\nthat he belonged after all.Marguerite let the tears have their way for a minute or two, and then\\r\\nshe sobbed out softly:\"But you don\\'t know what it\\'s all about. I—ought—to—explain.\"\"Explain, nothing!\" said Nelson comfortingly. \"I know all about it.\"\"Oh! How did you know?\" she asked with a perplexed frown, \"Did mother\\r\\ntell you?\"\"Never a word,\" said the young man taking out a big white handkerchief\\r\\nthat smelled of clover in summer, and unfolding it. \"Can\\'t you give me\\r\\ncredit for having eyes? When you love somebody, you understand.\"He lifted the girl\\'s hot tear-wet face and gently wiped it with the\\r\\ncool handkerchief.She felt as if she were a little girl being comforted.\"Oh, Nelson, you\\'ve always been wonderful! And—I—But you won\\'t\\r\\nfeel that way about me any more when you know everything. I\\'ve\\r\\nbeen—so—silly—! And wicked, Nelson! I\\'ve been terribly wicked. Oh—\" she\\r\\nshuddered,—\"to think that I—should have got into an awful mess like\\r\\nthat! Oh, I can\\'t ever stand myself again! How can I live? To think—\"\"See here, Marguerite, you\\'re not to think anything about it now. You\\r\\nare just to rest, and get over the shock. And by and bye when you are\\r\\nrested, we\\'ll talk it all out.\"\"But I want to get it over with first,\" said Marguerite sitting up and\\r\\ntrying to stop the tears with the big handkerchief. \"Indeed I can\\'t\\r\\nrest till you know what a fool I\\'ve been.\"\"All right,\" said Nelson, \"you\\'ve been a fool, have you? Well, I love\\r\\nyou anyway. Have you had any breakfast? No, I thought not. Well,\\r\\nneither have I. What if we stop somewhere and get some?\"\"But I can\\'t go anywhere with my eyes all red,\" objected the girl,\\r\\ndabbing away at them and looking as pretty as a picture even with a red\\r\\nnose, and her lashes all wet.\"That\\'s all right,\" said the young man easily, \"we\\'re going to get out\\r\\npretty soon and walk around the park a little. I think we\\'ll find a\\r\\nfountain or a spring or a lake or something wet, and we\\'ll mop up and\\r\\nget cooled off and then we\\'ll go and get fed.\"Marguerite giggled hysterically.\"You are always so good,\" she murmured, and then refinished it,\\r\\n\"so—dear!\"He stooped over and kissed her gravely on the forehead.\"Thank you for that, little one. Now, are you ready to get out and find\\r\\nthat fountain?\"\"Wait,\" said the girl sitting up, her face clouded with trouble again.\\r\\n\"Wait, Nelson, we can\\'t go on like this. We can\\'t even be friends again\\r\\ntill I tell you everything. It—chokes me!\"\"Out with it, then!\" said the young man calmly, \"but make it snappy.\\r\\nMake a clean breast of it in three sentences.\"\"Oh, Nelson, I fell in love with that man—a married man!\" She lifted\\r\\nher shamed face and looked at him through her tears.\"That\\'s number one,\" said Nelson, unperturbed.\"I started to run away with him and get married, without telling\\r\\nMother,\" she burst forth with a fresh rush of tears.\"Number two,\" counted Nelson.\"And—and—I\\'ve been awful to Mother, and to that Mrs. Dunlap—\" she\\r\\nchoked out, \"and—and—to God! I almost lost my senses!\"\"I inferred as much. Now, is that all, little sweetheart? And shall we\\r\\nget out and doll up for breakfast?\"She buried her face in the folds of the wet handkerchief once more, and\\r\\nfrom its depths murmured: \"Oh, Nelson, you always did take the ache out\\r\\nof things!\"\"That\\'s what I\\'m for,\" grinned Nelson delightedly, \"and I always intend\\r\\nto keep on doing it. You know you\\'re mine, little girl, have been ever\\r\\nsince we were children, and I don\\'t intend anything to hurt you any\\r\\nmore than I can possibly help. Of course, if you get sick—\" he smiled,\\r\\n\"mentally sick, or physically sick, or spiritually sick, I\\'ll just have\\r\\nto stand by and help till you get well again, but you\\'re mine, little\\r\\ngirl. I want that distinctly understood. Now, shall we get out and walk\\r\\na little?\"\"But Nelson—you mustn\\'t. I\\'m not worthy of a devotion like that—I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t let you—\"\"We\\'re getting out, driver,\" Nelson tapped on the glass.He helped her out and paid the fare, and while Marguerite stood still\\r\\nin the bright sunshine at the entrance to a Park pathway, the cool\\r\\nbreeze blowing on her hot cheeks and forehead, her face a little turned\\r\\naway lest the cabman should see that she had been crying, suddenly a\\r\\ngreat burden seemed to roll from her.She had expected to find herself desperate, agonized, unable to live\\r\\nlonger, when she got away from that terrible office where she had\\r\\nundergone such awful revelations; but suddenly it seemed to her a\\r\\ngreat relief. The fearful responsibilities of life that a day ago had\\r\\nlain upon her heart with deathlike heaviness, were gone. Life had been\\r\\nsettled for her, and her path diverted from a dark and perilous way,\\r\\ninto brightness and sunshine again.The only thing that hung about and troubled her was her own shame. Her\\r\\npart in the terrible drama that had just been played to the finish. Her\\r\\nfoolishness and gullibility, her readiness to fall for the handsome\\r\\neyes of a man of the world, whose flattery had been merely used for his\\r\\nown passing amusement. She, Marguerite Sheldon, with a long line of\\r\\nrespectable and noble ancestors, with a heritage of Christian training\\r\\nand tradition, with a mother such as hers had been, and a father whose\\r\\nmemory was enshrined forever in her heart! To think that she had been\\r\\nso easy to deceive!She started suddenly at the thought of how her heart was arraigning the\\r\\nman who had been her lover—almost her husband, but a few brief days\\r\\nago! Three hours ago she would have sworn to anyone who asked that she\\r\\nloved him with her whole soul; that life would be worthless without\\r\\nhim; that she would cling to him with her last breath though she were\\r\\nseparated from him for years; that she would love him and believe him,\\r\\nyes and even forgive him no matter what others said, no matter what he\\r\\nhad done.And now in a few short minutes, the cloak of illusion had been torn\\r\\nfrom him, and left his shame naked to her view; left him without a\\r\\ncharm or virtue; shown his love to be a mere worthless pretense, for\\r\\nhow could he possibly love her when he had so deceived her? How could\\r\\nhe dare bring her a love so dishonored by his own broken, worse than\\r\\nbroken vows? For she was not one of those girls who feel it a fine\\r\\nfeather to have won for herself a man who belongs to another.She shivered as she remembered the way he had said: \"My wife,\" and, \"my\\r\\ndaughters,\" in that accustomed married way. If she had heard nothing\\r\\nelse but that it would have convinced her. And sharply to her memory\\r\\ncame her own words to Mrs. Dunlap, \"Unless I can hear him say with his\\r\\nown lips—\"Well, she had heard him! How terrible it had been! Hot irons had seared\\r\\nher heart, and she would never, never forget!As she turned toward Nelson, she glanced down, and there in the path\\r\\nbehind him she caught the gleam of a bit of metal, gold or silver\\r\\nshining in the sun. It proved to be only a bit of foil wrapping from\\r\\ncandy or gum that someone had flung down carelessly in passing. But\\r\\nwith the unexplained whimsicality of such little inanimate things, it\\r\\ntook for the moment the form of a tiny trinket in likeness to a gold\\r\\nand platinum charm that the one-time Rufus Keller had worn on his watch\\r\\nchain. During those intimate days she had more than once toyed with it\\r\\nlovingly, pleased to think such was her privilege. She had even worn it\\r\\nabout her neck on a little gold chain for a few days, till alarmed lest\\r\\nher mother should see it, she had given it back for the time.Suddenly it came to her that he had worn it that very morning. She had\\r\\nnoticed its gleam as he turned away with that guilty look, that look\\r\\nthat she never would forget. The look that had torn from her heart the\\r\\nlast shred of respect, and what she had once thought was love for this\\r\\nman. And the little gleaming trinket had twinkled wickedly at her as he\\r\\nwent, and stabbed her with the things that she once had held so dear.\\r\\nStabbed her as when a thorn that has bruised the bleeding flesh is torn\\r\\naway and can hurt no more.She caught her breath in a sob as Nelson came up with her and slipped\\r\\nhis hand within her arm steadying her.\"Oh, how can I ever live? How can I ever, ever stand it?\" she gasped.\"Poor child!\" said Nelson sadly, \"Do you love him as much as that?\"\"Oh, no! No! Not now!\" she cried. \"That is all gone! But my\\r\\nself-respect is gone too! How can one live without self-respect?\"\"That will come back again!\" said Nelson Whitney with a ring in his\\r\\nvoice. Oh, it was good to hear her say she no longer cared!She was quiet for several minutes, and he watched her as they\\r\\nwalked along deeper into the park. Then she lifted her face like a\\r\\nrain-drenched flower.\"Nelson, you are wonderful!\" she said. \"I don\\'t—know—what I should\\r\\ndo—without you!\"\"Well, you don\\'t have to do without me, thank God!\" said Nelson. \"I\\r\\nsuppose this is why He sent me down here.\"She looked up with quick inquiry.\"How did you come, Nelson? Was it just chance?\"\"Nothing in this world is chance, is it, Daisy? But this certainly\\r\\nwasn\\'t, anyway. Why, you see I went to the house to get that list you\\r\\npromised—\"\"Oh!\" said the girl. \"I never thought of it again.\"\"Well, it\\'s of no consequence now,\" he grinned, \"I made up one instead\\r\\nand ordered the things. You\\'ll have to use what there is, or get more.\\r\\nHowever, when Mary and I started to look for the list there was your\\r\\nnote to your mother right on the floor by the stairs in the lower hall.\\r\\nHow it got there I don\\'t know, but as Mary was upstairs and I hadn\\'t\\r\\nmuch time, and the note was in your handwriting, I picked it up and\\r\\nread it. Of course I hadn\\'t gone far before I discovered it wasn\\'t the\\r\\nlist, but I couldn\\'t let it go then for I had caught a word or two that\\r\\nshowed me you were in danger, and that your mother must be somewhere\\r\\nin sorrow hunting for you, so I put it in my pocket as Mary came down\\r\\nstairs and took it away with me. If you ask me I think the Lord left\\r\\nthat note there for me to read. I thought you belonged enough to me to\\r\\ngive me the right to read it.\"Marguerite with reddening cheeks and shamed eyes was trying to recall\\r\\nwhat she had said in that mad hasty note she had left for her mother\\r\\nwhen she hurried to the midnight train.\"The rest was a cinch of course,\" went on Nelson. \"I had the address to\\r\\nwhich you were going in your own handwriting. I had only to meet you at\\r\\nthe train in New York as it came in, if I could get there ahead of you.\\r\\nOr, failing in that, as I did, I had the second chance of catching you\\r\\nat the office before you went off to marry that villain.\"Marguerite\\'s shamed face did not lift, but a little quiver went through\\r\\nher slight frame.\"But—how did you get here in time?\" she asked. \"Why, that must have\\r\\nbeen rather late in the morning when you found that note. Of course I\\r\\nknew there was an early morning train and that Mother would probably\\r\\ntake that, but I had hoped to have everything straightened out before\\r\\nshe came. But the only other train after you found out is a local, and\\r\\nyou couldn\\'t possibly have got here even yet unless you flew. Are you a\\r\\nmystery man?\"\"That\\'s exactly what I did. I flew here,\" said Nelson.\"What do you mean?\" she asked lifting wondering eyes that seemed to\\r\\nhave forgotten their trouble for the moment. \"Don\\'t tease me, please.\\r\\nI\\'m so tired!\" And she drooped upon his arm.\"Poor little girl! I\\'m forgetting all you\\'ve gone through. We\\'ll find\\r\\nthat water, and then go for something to eat. If I remember, it was\\r\\ndown this path. I came here once three years ago, and thought how some\\r\\nday I would perhaps bring you.\"A quick turn brought them to a spring gurgling in a granite basin, and\\r\\nMarguerite dashed the water in her face and dried it on another big\\r\\nclean handkerchief that Nelson brought forth from a capacious pocket.\"Do you have an unlimited supply of these?\" she asked as she emerged\\r\\nfrom its fragrant folds gratefully, refreshed in spite of herself.\"Very nearly!\" he smiled. \"Now come, and we will go and find something\\r\\nto eat.\"\"But you haven\\'t told me what you mean by saying you flew here.\" He\\r\\nnoticed that her voice was almost cheerful again.\"Just that,\" he said laughing, \"I flew. It\\'s the first time in my life,\\r\\nbut I would have enjoyed it if I hadn\\'t been so worried about you.\"Then as her eyes looked still mystified, he explained.\"I have a friend who has been coaxing me to fly with him for months\\r\\nand I never seemed to have time. He had oodles of money, and no end\\r\\nof time, and so I just made good a promise I had given him once, and\\r\\ncalled him up. He was game all right, said of course he was going to\\r\\nNew York in a couple of hours, and so we came. We got here sometime\\r\\nbefore your train came in. By the way, why didn\\'t you come on it?\"\"I did,\" she said sadly, \"but I got off at the wrong station, something\\r\\nthey called Manhattan Transfer. I had to wait ages before another came\\r\\nalong.\"\"Manhattan Transfer! And you were knocking around that desolate place\\r\\nalone at that time of night? Well, I\\'ll say your angels must have had\\r\\ntheir hands full taking care of you yesterday. They must be all worn\\r\\nout. I guess that\\'s why I have the job for a little while now. Come,\\r\\nhere\\'s a taxi!\"She flashed him a faint little flicker of a smile and he helped her\\r\\ninto the cab with a lighter heart. At least the days of reticence and\\r\\ndistance were over between them. No more reservations, no more holding\\r\\naloof. She was confiding in him as she used to do. One couldn\\'t expect\\r\\nmore than that, so soon.They went to a quiet tea room. Nelson seemed to know just how to manage\\r\\neverything, seemed to know without asking his way anywhere. He put her\\r\\nin a seat where she was sheltered, and he ordered the things he knew\\r\\nfrom long years of association that she liked. Deftly, unobtrusively,\\r\\nhe drew her attention away from herself, and the tragic happenings\\r\\nof the last few days, tempted her to eat, provoked her to laugh. He\\r\\ndescribed his first sensations of flying, telling little anecdotes\\r\\nof his friend the aviator when they were both together in France,\\r\\ntelling a joke he had heard the day before, calling her attention to\\r\\na beautiful white kitten that came purring in to be stroked and fed\\r\\ntidbits.It was nearly three o\\'clock when they had finished the meal. The color\\r\\nwas stealing faintly back to the girl\\'s lips and cheeks, and the terror\\r\\nfading out of her eyes.\"Now,\" said Nelson consulting his watch, \"it\\'s three minutes to three.\\r\\nWhat do you want to do? Shall we make good our word and go to the Tomb\\r\\nand the Museum, or shall we save that for another day and go back to\\r\\nthe hotel and let you get a good rest?\"\"Oh,\" said Marguerite, shrinking suddenly, the color receding from her\\r\\nlips, the terror coming back to her eyes. \"Oh, I can\\'t go back—yet!\\r\\nBut don\\'t let me detain you—I\\'ll—I\\'ll just wander around a little—I\\'ll\\r\\ngo—shopping!\" she ended with an attempt at briskness in her voice.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve been awfully good.\"\"Now, look here, Marguerite, haven\\'t I known you too long and loved\\r\\nyou too well, for you to get off any bunk like that on me?\" he asked\\r\\nlaughing. \"I\\'m here to take care of you, and what you want to do is\\r\\nwhat I want to do. What I meant is, are you too tired to take on sight\\r\\nseeing or are you really interested? It occurred to me that we weren\\'t\\r\\neither of us in a state to get much intellectual good out of either a\\r\\ntomb or a museum, but perhaps I\\'m mistaken. If you want to, we\\'ll go.\\r\\nBut if you are not particular which day we go tombing, suppose we take\\r\\na lighter expedition. I\\'ll tell you what would just suit me. I\\'d like\\r\\nto take you down to Tiffany\\'s and buy you the prettiest diamond ring we\\r\\ncan find.\"Marguerite started back in her chair.\"Oh, Nelson! What do you mean?\"Her face was a curious study of tenderness and fear.\"I mean just that, Daisy. I think it\\'s high time you had some kind of a\\r\\nsafeguard to wear. I\\'ve loved you too long and known you too well, to\\r\\nlet you drift around the world unprotected any longer.\"\"But—Nelson—\"\"Yes, I know—you want to tell me that you don\\'t love me—that you\\r\\ncouldn\\'t possibly love one man when you\\'ve just got over caring for\\r\\nanother, and all that—but I\\'m going to do this anyway. The chances are\\r\\nthat you may some day find out you do care a little and then everything\\r\\nwill be all right. But if you don\\'t, why, there are such things as\\r\\nbroken engagements.\"You don\\'t have to marry me if you find out I\\'m a villain, or that you\\r\\nlove somebody else better. But you do have to wear my ring for a while\\r\\nanyway. You\\'re not going back home without it, I\\'ll tell the world.\\r\\nNobody is going to have a chance, not that dirty crook of a Keller\\r\\nanyway, to say that he threw you over. You\\'re going home engaged to me,\\r\\nMarguerite Sheldon, whatever you do with me afterward, you may as well\\r\\nunderstand that I have the upper hand now, and you\\'re going to have a\\r\\nring, right now!\"You can take it for all the love I have in the world, if you\\'re\\r\\nwilling, or you can take it for just a means of protection for the time\\r\\nbeing if that suits you any better, but somehow I\\'m going to put my tag\\r\\non my property. Until you\\'ve told me that you out and out can\\'t love me\\r\\never, I\\'m out to see that you\\'re known as belonging to me.\"There was such quiet strength and tenderness in the way he said these\\r\\nwords, so low that they could not possibly reach other ears than her\\r\\nown, so full of real feeling and earnestness, that she could not turn\\r\\naway from, nor laugh it off. It choked her to think how great and\\r\\ntender he was to her.\"Nelson, you\\'re sorry for me and you\\'re dear, but you don\\'t need to go\\r\\nto such lengths,\" she began helplessly.\"Marguerite,\" he rebuked her, \"that\\'s beneath you. You know I never\\r\\nlie! You know I would not say it if it were not the dearest wish of my\\r\\nheart. You know I\\'ve loved you ever since I can remember.\"She was still a long time, the sweet color coming into her cheeks;\\r\\nlifting she eyes at last she said:\"Nelson, forgive me I shouldn\\'t have said that. I know what you\\'ve\\r\\nalways been. But I didn\\'t know till to-day quite how wonderful you\\r\\nwere. I believe you, and I think it\\'s the greatest thing in the world\\r\\nyou have done for me. Your love is the greatest thing the world can\\r\\never give me, and I\\'m sure I don\\'t know what I would ever be without\\r\\nyou. I would tell you that I love you too, only I\\'ve been so many kinds\\r\\nof a fool the last year and a half that I don\\'t even trust myself to\\r\\nsay it. It seems cowardly of me to creep into the refuge you offer me,\\r\\nwhen I have so little to give. A threadbare love that was thrown away\\r\\non an old married man with grown daughters!\"His face grew strangely tender.\"That\\'s all right, little girl, I understand what you\\'ve been through.\\r\\nIt\\'s no wonder you distrust yourself, but I trust you, when you get rid\\r\\nof the mists and get back to yourself. We\\'ll strike square with each\\r\\nother and you can trust me. I won\\'t ask you to marry me till you\\'re\\r\\nready, and not then if you don\\'t love me enough to be happy with me,\\r\\nbetter than any other man on earth—but I do ask you to wear my ring\\r\\nhome and let it be a shelter to you, in any complex circumstances that\\r\\nthis situation may happen to bring about.\"She was still a long time, drawing little patterns with the tip of\\r\\nher spoon on the table cloth. At last she lifted hesitating eyes half\\r\\nshamed.\"Nelson—have you thought what Mother will think if I do this? Off with\\r\\nthe old love and on with the new? Won\\'t Mother be more horrified than\\r\\never at me? Won\\'t she think I\\'m utterly false at heart?\"\"Your mother will simply jump for joy,\" said Nelson Whitney solemnly.\\r\\n\"Take it from me. It would be the happiest moment of her life if she\\r\\ncould see my ring on your hand and know you wanted it there.\"\"So soon—after—\"\"The sooner the quicker!\" said Nelson, wrinkling his face into his\\r\\nnicest smile. \"Come! Let\\'s go!\"She followed him in a tumult of joy and doubt. Could it be right for\\r\\nher to be happy like this, when only a few hours ago she had been—But Nelson was summoning another taxi, and in a few whirls they were\\r\\nentering the great Fifth Avenue store.When she came out again a little while later, after going the beautiful\\r\\nrounds among priceless jewels and fragile glass that looked like the\\r\\nbreath of a frozen flower, she was wearing his ring on her hand, and a\\r\\nsoft depth of joy in her eyes that was good to see.\"And now,\" said Nelson, as he summoned another taxi, \"I think we had\\r\\nbetter go and find Mother, and tell her all about it, don\\'t you? It\\r\\nseems to me she has suffered about long enough.\"IT WAS late that evening before mother and daughter were alone at last.Mrs. Dunlap had responded to a telegram and left on the seven o\\'clock\\r\\ntrain for Boston to meet in conference with an important committee on\\r\\nsome international work for young women.Nelson Whitney had attended to all her wants as the son of the family\\r\\nmight have waited on a powerful ally who had pulled them all out of\\r\\ndistress.He took Mrs. Sheldon and her daughter to a wonderful symphony orchestra\\r\\nconcert with a soloist of world reputation, and then brought them back\\r\\nto the hotel refusing to remain for even a few minutes because they\\r\\nneeded to rest. He attended them up to the door of their room, kissed\\r\\nMarguerite reverently, and then half shyly kissed her mother and said:\\r\\n\"Good night, Mother!\" with an accent in his tone that spoke volumes.He left both mother and daughter tingling with joy and pride in him,\\r\\nand then at last the door was closed on the outer world, shutting them\\r\\nin alone together.The girl hurried into the closet to hang up her coat and hat, feeling a\\r\\nsudden shyness before her mother, realizing all at once that there were\\r\\nsome things that must be made clear between them before she could feel\\r\\nthat all was right.The mother removed her street things slowly, a light of almost\\r\\nother-worldly joy in her face. She was thinking of what her new friend\\r\\nhad said to her that afternoon, and of the Bible verse she had quoted\\r\\nto her. And how wonderfully, and swiftly the promise had been made good\\r\\nto her. Why, she had scarcely waked from that refreshing sleep into\\r\\nwhich she had fallen pillowed on that promise, when the fulfillment had\\r\\nknocked at her door in the person of Nelson and Marguerite come to show\\r\\nher the ring.Marguerite had been shy and lovely, but almost silent and they had not\\r\\npressed her to talk much. She had been most humble and loving toward\\r\\nher mother and Mrs. Dunlap, thanking that great-hearted woman in no\\r\\nuncertain words, although they were few, and clasping her in a close\\r\\npenitent embrace when she left.But to her mother Marguerite had as yet said not one word about the\\r\\nhappenings of the last few days. She had let her lover do all the\\r\\ntalking, and had sat with downcast lashes, and a childlike contentment\\r\\nin her face that yet spoke volumes of reassurance to the two who had\\r\\nwaited through the long hours to know how it fared with her.But now the time had come, and Marguerite knew it, to have it out with\\r\\nher mother.She stayed in the closet several minutes arranging her things, being\\r\\nmost careful about how her hat was placed on the shelf, and searching\\r\\nin her coat pocket for a handkerchief she was not sure was there. But\\r\\nat last she came out.Mrs. Sheldon was taking down her hair for the night, and it fell in\\r\\nlovely silver waves to her waist, with soft little tendrils, and a curl\\r\\nor two at the ends. It seemed to glorify her delicate face and set her\\r\\noff as if it had been a halo.The girl watched her lovely mother for a moment, wistfully, wishing she\\r\\nwould begin, and then suddenly she burst forth with tears:\"I don\\'t see how I could have done it to you!\" she said in a cry of\\r\\nsorrow. \"You are so dear and lovely, and here I\\'ve led you through all\\r\\nthis horrible mess! I don\\'t see how you can ever love me again!\"With one swift movement, as if she had been young again, the mother\\r\\nturned and folded her child in her arms.\"My darling!\" she said. \"Oh, my darling!\" And held her so close she\\r\\ncould hardly breathe.It was a long time they stood so, Marguerite\\'s face hidden in her\\r\\nmother\\'s neck, the mother\\'s lips against her child\\'s hot forehead,\\r\\ntouching her hair with caresses that could not be measured nor counted\\r\\nnor described because it would be a desecration.No words passed between them, nor was there any need. It was as if\\r\\ntheir thoughts were as open to one another as if they had been one, so\\r\\nclose their hearts seemed to come.At last the girl lifted her hot, shamed, forgiven face to her mother.\\r\\nThere was one more thing that had to be spoken:\"Mother, you must think I\\'m an awful fool. You must think awful things\\r\\nof me that I let Nelson—that he—that I—so soon after—\" She hid her\\r\\nshamed face once more on her mother\\'s shoulder, and the mother arms\\r\\nclasped her close again.\"No, dear, I don\\'t think awful things. I think my girl has been through\\r\\na bewildering experience and didn\\'t know her own mind, was not capable\\r\\nof judging, but I think you have come back to your senses again, and\\r\\nI thank God that you have such a wonderful friend as Nelson who has\\r\\nbeen willing after all the suffering you have given him through these\\r\\nmonths, to put the protection of his love about you. He could not be a\\r\\ngreater comfort to me, and to you if he were my own son.\"The girl was still a long time, and then she said timidly:\"Yes, Mother, he is wonderful! More wonderful even than I have told you\\r\\nyet or you have seen. But Mother, you think I let him get that ring\\r\\njust to protect me from gossips, just to let others see that I had not\\r\\nbeen a fool! But I didn\\'t, Mother. I truly didn\\'t! I couldn\\'t have done\\r\\nthat not even to protect you from all the shame and disgrace of having\\r\\npeople find out just what really did happen. I couldn\\'t have unless I\\r\\nhad loved him. You think perhaps it couldn\\'t be true love so soon after\\r\\nI thought I was dying for that other man, but it is, it is. It seems as\\r\\nif I had never really known love before.\"Why, Mother, when Nelson began to tell me how he felt toward me, and\\r\\nwhat I was to him, it opened a whole new world to me. I hadn\\'t known\\r\\nwhat love was before. I hadn\\'t dreamed what it could be. It seemed as\\r\\nif the other had just been a cheap imitation of it. It showed up the\\r\\nother experience. I began to see in contrast how selfish Rufus—I mean\\r\\nMr. Oliver—had been, how all he talked about was a good time, something\\r\\nto amuse—how he did not seem to care about whether I was pleased or\\r\\nnot, only to bend me to his will. It hadn\\'t seemed that way at all\\r\\nbefore. But Mother, I\\'ve been thinking about it all the evening, trying\\r\\nto see how I could make you understand, and I believe I was just proud\\r\\nto think a man as wise and experienced as I thought he was, had stooped\\r\\nto notice me, and I was frantic when I thought I had lost him.\"But Mother, I didn\\'t know the deep sweet joy I feel now in Nelson. I\\r\\ndidn\\'t know there was such joy. Truly, Mother and you know it isn\\'t\\r\\nas if I had just met Nelson—he\\'s been dear always—always—since I was\\r\\njust a little girl, only he never opened this door to his soul before\\r\\nand let me see how he had put me in his heart on a throne. And it has\\r\\njust carried me into heaven, Mother, but I know you think I haven\\'t any\\r\\nright—not a bit of right to it—since—since—\"\"Yes, you have, my dear. I do think you have. I have watched your\\r\\nface. You are a different girl. You have met the real thing at last\\r\\nand recognized it. I couldn\\'t have hoped it would come to you so soon.\\r\\nI was fearful what might happen to you in the interval, till our new\\r\\nfriend showed me that I might trust you with my heavenly Father. And\\r\\nsomehow, my precious child, I believe He let this come to you so soon\\r\\njust to show us both how He can heal, and how He will lead and save and\\r\\nbless those who trust Him entirely with their lives.\"Said the girl, laying her hot cheek against her mother\\'s soft one:\"Oh, Mother! You are the most wonderful woman in the world! And Mrs.\\r\\nDunlap is next. What should we have done without her? Suppose I had\\r\\ngone on and had my own way! Suppose—suppose—I had lost Nelson! Just\\r\\nthink! Even if the other man hadn\\'t been what he was—suppose I had\\r\\nmissed knowing Nelson\\'s love! Oh, Mother! You don\\'t know how wonderful\\r\\nNelson is! I can never make you understand. He is—different! He\\r\\nis—wonderful!\"\"I believe it!\" said the mother fervently. \"And now let us kneel down\\r\\nand thank God for the wonderful way in which he has led us.\"A little later, while her mother was preparing for the night,\\r\\nMarguerite took out her little Bible that always traveled with her when\\r\\nshe went anywhere because it was a part of the fittings of the bag\\r\\nwhich her mother had given her the Christmas before. Opening it, she\\r\\npaused with startled eyes. At last she said:\"Mother, listen to this. I opened right to it, Isaiah 42.16, \\'I will\\r\\nbring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths\\r\\nthat they have not known: I will make darkness light before them,\\r\\nand crooked things straight. These things will I do to them, and not\\r\\nforsake them.\\' Mother, that was what He did for me. I was blind!\"\\r\\nTHE END\\n\\r\\nThe Inimitable \"Pansy\"\\nEighty-seven years old, a pain-wracked invalid—yet the author of \"Ester\\r\\nReid,\" \"Four Girls At Chautauqua,\" \"Mrs. Solomon Smith,\" has lost none\\r\\nof her earlier power and spontaneity. The problems of yesterday are the\\r\\nproblems of to-day, though they may be furnished with electric lights,\\r\\nairplanes and automobiles to make them up-to-date. And Pansy knows\\r\\nlife—her stories are real—they strike to the very heart of the girl and\\r\\nboy, the man and woman—they show us ourselves as God sees us—the real\\r\\nperson beneath the sham and mockery of society. She weaves her stories\\r\\naround the common everyday lives of the people she knows—till her\\r\\ncharacters become alive and real to those who read.A marvelous housekeeper; an ideal pastor\\'s wife who took the whole\\r\\nparish into her life, who knew them and loved them, who cared for the\\r\\nsick and gathered the young people around her for a good time; a woman\\r\\nmuch in demand in public life as director of religious conferences and\\r\\nas a lecturer and, above all, an author beloved by thousands.Many years ago she edited a small paper, \"The Pansy,\" a Herculean\\r\\ntask, for it brought her thousands of letters from the children who\\r\\nhad joined the Pansy Society and wrote her about their faults and how\\r\\nto correct them. And other letters poured in, too, from all over the\\r\\nglobe, asking for her autograph and photograph, for advice on how to\\r\\nbecome a great author, on how to get the right kind of a husband, and\\r\\non every other question under the sun. And Pansy answered every letter,\\r\\nusually by her own hand.Hers has been a busy life and a happy one—and an inspiration to\\r\\nthousands who have known her or her books. And to-day, bereft of\\r\\nhusband and children, a cripple, she fights bravely on, writing the\\r\\nstory of her life: \"Yesterdays\"—the beautiful record of a happy and\\r\\nconsecrated life.\\r\\n———————————————————————————\\n\\r\\nJ.

      "FOREWORD\n",
      "AS LONG ago as I can remember there was always a radiant being who was\n",
      "next to my mother and father in my heart, and who seemed to me to be a\n",
      "sort of a combination of fairy godmother, heroine, and saint. I thought\n",
      "her the most beautiful, wise, and wonderful person in my world, outside\n",
      "of my home. I treasured her smiles, copied her ways, and listened\n",
      "breathlessly to all she had to say, sitting at her feet worshipfully\n",
      "whenever she was near; ready to run any errand for her, no matter how\n",
      "far.I measured other people by her principles and opinions, and always\n",
      "felt that her word was final. I am afraid I even corrected my beloved\n",
      "parents sometimes when they failed to state some principle or opinion\n",
      "as she had done.When she came on a visit the house seemed glorified because of her\n",
      "presence; while she remained, life was one long holiday; when she went\n",
      "away it seemed as if a blight had fallen.Her eyes were dark and had interesting twinkles in them that children\n",
      "loved; her hair was long and dark and very heavy, dressed in two wide\n",
      "braids that were wound round and round her lovely head in smooth coils,\n",
      "fitting close like a cap, but when it was unbraided and brushed out,\n",
      "it fell far below her knees and was like a garment folding her about.\n",
      "How I adored that hair and longed to have hair just like it! How I even\n",
      "used in secret to tie an old brown veil about my head and let it fall\n",
      "down my back, and try to see how it would feel to have hair like that.She had delicate features and a wonderful smile. Nobody else in the\n",
      "world looked just as lovely as did she. But once I found a picture of\n",
      "Longfellow's Evangeline in a photograph album, in exquisite classic\n",
      "profile, and thought it was her likeness. She was like that—if you have\n",
      "that old faded photograph somewhere in an old album with quaint clasps.\n",
      "She was wonderful!And she was young, gracious, and very good to be with.This radiant creature was known to me by the name of \"Auntie Belle,\"\n",
      "though my mother and my grandmother, called her \"Isabella!\" Just like\n",
      "that! Even sharply sometimes when they disagreed with her—\"Isabella!\" I\n",
      "wondered that they dared. I sometimes resented it.Later I found that other people had still other names for her. To the\n",
      "congregation of which her husband was pastor she was known as \"Mrs.\n",
      "Alden.\" It seemed to me too grownup a name for her and made her appear\n",
      "more stately and sedate than she really was. I remember resenting it\n",
      "that these strange people should seem to have rights in her. She was\n",
      "mine. What were they?But when a little later my world grew larger, and knowledge increased,\n",
      "I found that this precious aunt of mine did not belong entirely to us\n",
      "as I had supposed. She had another world in which she moved and had\n",
      "her being when she went from us from time to time; or when at certain\n",
      "hours in the day she shut herself within a room that was sacredly known\n",
      "as a \"study,\" and wrote for a long time, while we all tried to keep\n",
      "still; and in this other world of hers she was known as \"Pansy.\" It was\n",
      "a world that loved and honored her, a world that gave her homage and\n",
      "flowers, and wrote her letters by the hundreds each week.It was not long, too, before I had learned to preen myself like a young\n",
      "peacock because I \"belonged\" to her, and I am afraid I felt a superior\n",
      "pity and contempt for the thousands of other children who read her\n",
      "paper called \"The Pansy\" which she edited, but who did not \"belong\"\n",
      "to her. They could only write letters to her, while I could often be\n",
      "with her every day, sometimes for weeks, and could talk with her all I\n",
      "pleased.As I grew still older and learned to read I devoured her stories\n",
      "chapter by chapter. Even sometimes page by page as they came hot from\n",
      "the typewriter; occasionally stealing in for an instant when she left\n",
      "the study, to snatch the latest page and see what happened next; or to\n",
      "accost her as her morning's work was done, with: \"Oh, have you finished\n",
      "another chapter?\"And often the whole family would crowd around, leaving their work when\n",
      "the word went around that the last chapter was finished and it was\n",
      "going to be read aloud. And now we listened, breathless, as she read,\n",
      "and made her characters live before us. They were real people to us, as\n",
      "real as if they lived and breathed before us.She was at the height of her popularity just then, and the letters that\n",
      "poured in at every mail were overwhelming. Asking for her autograph\n",
      "and her photograph, begging for pieces of her best dress to sew into\n",
      "patchwork; begging for advice how to become a great author; begging for\n",
      "advice on every possible subject, from how to get the right kind of a\n",
      "husband, to how to stop biting one's nails.And she answered them all!It was a Herculean task. Sometimes she let us help her when she was\n",
      "very much rushed, but usually she kept her touch on every letter that\n",
      "went out—and they were thousands.Then there was the editorship of \"The Pansy,\" a young people's paper\n",
      "which was responsible for more thousands of letters from the children\n",
      "who had joined the Pansy Society, and who wrote to her about their\n",
      "faults and how to give them up, \"For Jesus' Sake,\" which was their\n",
      "motto.Sometimes I look back on her long and busy life and marvel what she has\n",
      "accomplished.She was a marvelous housekeeper, knowing every dainty detail of her\n",
      "home to perfection; able to cook anything in the world just a little\n",
      "better than anybody else—except my mother and her—; able to set fine\n",
      "stitches in patches and darning that were works of art; able to make\n",
      "even dishwashing fun!Sometimes when we were all together for a season, visiting, or during\n",
      "the winters we spent in Florida and lived together, it fell to her\n",
      "part and mine to do the dinner dishes together every night, and we\n",
      "raced, she washing, I wiping and putting away; making a record each\n",
      "night and trying to beat it the next. And such good, good times as we\n",
      "had together, my beloved aunt and I, as we worked with a will and left\n",
      "the kitchen immaculate for the next morning. Oh, she was a wonderful\n",
      "housekeeper!Yes, and a marvelous pastor's wife! She took the whole parish into her\n",
      "life and gave herself to the work. She was not a modern minister's\n",
      "wife, who only goes to teas and receptions, and plays bridge and\n",
      "attends to the social end of life, never bothering about the church.\n",
      "She was the real old-fashioned kind, who made calls on all the\n",
      "parishioners with her husband, knew every member intimately, cared for\n",
      "the sick, gathered the young people into her home making both a social\n",
      "and religious center for them with herself as leader and adviser; grew\n",
      "intimate with each one personally and led them to Christ; became their\n",
      "confidante; and loved them all as if they had been her brothers and\n",
      "sisters. She taught the Primary class—and incidentally the mothers of\n",
      "the Primary class. She quietly and unobtrusively managed the Missionary\n",
      "Society and the Ladies' Aid, not always as its executive officer,\n",
      "often keeping quite in the background. She became the dear friend of\n",
      "every woman in the church without making any of them jealous. She was\n",
      "beloved, almost adored of them all.She was a tender, vigilant, wonderful mother, such a mother as few are\n",
      "privileged to have, giving without stint of her time and her strength\n",
      "and her love and her companionship.Even while she was quite young, when I was a small child she began to\n",
      "go out into the world, to speak in public, to read her stories, to lead\n",
      "Primary Sunday School Conferences, and, as I grew older and developed\n",
      "a delight in drawing, she sometimes took me along to do her blackboard\n",
      "work for her, at which privilege I swelled with pride. She was much in\n",
      "demand in those days, and I remember the awe with which I regarded her\n",
      "as one of the great ones of the earth, who was paid large sums to tell\n",
      "other people the best ways of teaching, and to read her fascinating\n",
      "stories. How I loved her and hung upon her every word and smile. How\n",
      "proud I was to belong to her! And am still.All these things she did, and yet wrote books! Stories out of real\n",
      "life, that struck home and showed us to ourselves as God saw us; that\n",
      "sent us to our knees to talk with Him.With marvelous skill she searched hearts, especially of the easy-going\n",
      "Christian, whether minister or layman, young and old, and brought them\n",
      "awake and alive to their inconsistencies. She wove her stories around\n",
      "their common, everyday life, till all her characters became alive and\n",
      "real to those who read. They still live within our memories like people\n",
      "we have known intimately and dwelt among. Ester Reid and Julia Reid,\n",
      "the Four Girls at Chautauqua, Mrs. Solomon Smith. I almost expect to\n",
      "meet some of them in Heaven.Perhaps she wrote more and better because she was doing so eagerly in\n",
      "every direction. Her public, her church, her family, her home.I wish I might paint you a picture of that home as I knew it; of my\n",
      "home, its counterpart; of the years the two families spent much time\n",
      "together as one family. The days were one long dream. Hard work? Yes,\n",
      "but good fellowship. Everybody working together with a common aim, and\n",
      "joy in the work and the fellowship!And the evenings! Oh, those evenings, the crown of the days, the time\n",
      "to which we all looked forward as to a goal when our work was done!\n",
      "Those evenings are bright spots in my youth. Especially the evenings\n",
      "of the years we all spent together in Florida, when the sun went\n",
      "down sharply and the light went velvet black at evening, until the\n",
      "great tropical moon came out. Those long evenings when the soft dense\n",
      "darkness shut us in to a cheerful supper table, and, after we had\n",
      "hustled through the dishes, we all gathered in the big sitting-room\n",
      "around the open fire for family worship. Yes, we were as old-fashioned\n",
      "as that! We had family worship both morning and evening. And I am not\n",
      "of those modern ones who tell such things to scoff at them and say how\n",
      "sick they got of religion because of it, and lay to that their present\n",
      "indifference to God and the Bible. I look back to those times as the\n",
      "most precious, the most beautiful, the most powerful influence that\n",
      "came into my life. I thank God for a family that worshipped Him morning\n",
      "and evening and gave me an early knowledge and love for the Bible and\n",
      "the things of the Kingdom. Either my uncle or my father would conduct\n",
      "the little service, and often the one or the other of them would say to\n",
      "my dear aunt: \"You read the chapter to-night, Belle,\" just because she\n",
      "was such a beautiful reader and we all loved to listen to her. At other\n",
      "times, we would recite verses, all around, a verse apiece, and then\n",
      "kneel in a circle for the prayer.Oh, those prayers of the years that made my life inevitably acquainted\n",
      "with God, and the Lord Jesus, so that I never could be troubled by the\n",
      "doubts of to-day, because I know Him, \"whom to know is life eternal.\"\n",
      "I cannot be thankful enough for those prayers, and that sacred time of\n",
      "worship every day that brought me into His very Presence.And then the evening that followed!We would all get our work, sewing or drawing, painting or knitting,\n",
      "or embroidery. My father, and my uncle would each take his particular\n",
      "chair in a shaded corner, and a book would be brought out. It was\n",
      "always a book that had been selected with great care, usually a story,\n",
      "now and again a great missionary book but more often a good novel.\n",
      "And this aunt would usually do the reading. Sometimes my aunt and my\n",
      "mother took turns reading. They both were remarkable readers, and\n",
      "knit close in spirit since early childhood. For two, sometimes three\n",
      "beautiful hours we reveled in the book. Reluctantly, when the word\n",
      "went forth that it was time to stop, we folded up our work and went to\n",
      "bed—sometimes pleading for just another chapter—now and then actually\n",
      "staying up breathless till all hours to finish some great climax. We\n",
      "always went off to rest with a bright eagerness for the morrow and the\n",
      "evening, and the story again—or a new one if we had finished one.So we read the works of George Macdonald—we loved the Scotch, and our\n",
      "readers knew how to put the burr of the dialect upon their tongues—Ian\n",
      "Maclaren, Barrie—much of Dickens, some of Scott, Björnson, William Dean\n",
      "Howells, Jean Ingelow's few matchless novels, Frank Stockton, with his\n",
      "charming absurdities and a host of other writers whose stories seem to\n",
      "have become submerged and forgotten in this day of modern literature.\n",
      "But I look back to those stories as my meeting time with the great\n",
      "of the earth. How real the Bonnie Brier Bush and all its quaint true\n",
      "people were! How tender and strong was the Marquis of Lossie and Sir\n",
      "Gibbie! How I thrilled over the \"Men of the Moss Hags,\" \"Ben Hur,\" \"The\n",
      "Virginian,\" \"Jane Eyre.\" I mention them at random. It is my ambition\n",
      "to some day possess in a special set of shelves, every one of those\n",
      "wonderful stories that thrilled me so when I was young. Oh, don't\n",
      "try to tell me I would not care for them now! I do. They were real\n",
      "books, books that do not change because they told of human life as it\n",
      "is really lived in hearts. They may need to be furnished with a few\n",
      "electric lights and radios and airplanes and automobiles to make them\n",
      "up-to-date, but otherwise you will not find them out of tune with life\n",
      "as it is to-day, except that they are perhaps too clean and wholesome\n",
      "to be natural to-day.There were frequent times when this beloved aunt, around whom we all\n",
      "seemed in those days to center, was called away to deliver an address,\n",
      "or to conduct a conference, or to furnish an evening's entertainment\n",
      "in some distant place; but when she returned from one of these trips\n",
      "we all gathered around to hear her tell her experiences, for we were\n",
      "always sure of stories. She saw everything, and she knew how to tell\n",
      "with glowing words about the days she had been away so that she lived\n",
      "them over again for us. It was almost better than if we had been along\n",
      "because she knew how to bring out the touch of pathos or beauty or fun,\n",
      "and her characters were all portraits. It listened like a book.It was on one of these occasions that she told on her return from\n",
      "a trip, the story of this book. I remember it as if it were but\n",
      "yesterday, though the whole thing happened many years ago, for modern\n",
      "as this story is, the main part of it happened, really happened, to her\n",
      "personal knowledge, over thirty-five years ago.It was told to her by a woman who was so well-known all over our\n",
      "country at that time that if I were to name her you could not help\n",
      "but remember how active she was in Woman's Suffrage and W. C. T. U.\n",
      "work, besides several other notable reforms and organizations. She was\n",
      "a brilliant public speaker, much in demand, and a great worker for\n",
      "young girls. She recounted this story to my aunt as a recent personal\n",
      "experience, and gave her permission to use it in a story (after a\n",
      "suitable interval of time of course, and without the original names.)The story was written in brief form and appeared several years after\n",
      "its happening in a periodical as a short serial; but it is now\n",
      "appearing in book form for the first time. The dear author, after an\n",
      "interval of several years, during which on account of ill health and a\n",
      "feeling that her work was done, has taken up her pen once more. But at\n",
      "what odds! She is now eighty-seven years old and confined to her bed,\n",
      "the result of a fall and a broken hip. In the intervals of pain she has\n",
      "been elaborating and preparing this story for book form.And now, because the manuscript was to have been in the hands of the\n",
      "publisher long ago, and because pain has held her in its grip for an\n",
      "unusually long period of weeks lately, leaving her unfit for work for\n",
      "the present, she has trusted me with the task of putting it into final\n",
      "shape. This story seems to me peculiarly fitting as a message for this\n",
      "present time.I approach the work with a kind of awe upon me that I should be working\n",
      "on her story!If, long ago in my childhood, it had been told me that I should ever be\n",
      "counted worthy to do this, I would not have believed it. Before her I\n",
      "shall always feel like the little worshipful child I used to be.I recall a Christmas long ago when I was just beginning to write scraps\n",
      "of stories myself, with no thought of ever amounting to anything as a\n",
      "writer. Her gift to me that year was a thousand sheets of typewriter\n",
      "paper; and in a sweet little note that accompanied it she wished me\n",
      "success and bade me turn those thousand sheets of paper into as many\n",
      "dollars.It was my first real encouragement. The first hint that anybody thought\n",
      "I ever could write, and I laughed aloud at the utter impossibility\n",
      "of its ever coming true. But I feel that my first inspiration for\n",
      "story-telling came from her, and from reading her books in which as a\n",
      "child I fairly steeped myself.So I beg the leniency of her readers of to-day as I approach the task\n",
      "that is set before me. I know I shall have hers. My one hope is that I\n",
      "shall not in any way mar the message of this true and thrilling tale,\n",
      "that certainly is needed in this day and generation. I trust that she\n",
      "may soon be well enough to write once more, herself, another tale as\n",

      "seat directly in front of Mary Dunlap, and before she realized it,\n",
      "she was thoroughly absorbed in studying them, her interest caught by\n",
      "the singularly pure and lovely outline of the young woman's face, in\n",
      "profile.They were apparently a young married couple, though the man was not so\n",
      "young as the girl, who looked entirely too young to be married yet. As\n",
      "she studied them she could not help wondering over the girl's choice of\n",
      "a husband. They did not seem at all well mated. The girl was the far\n",
      "more attractive of the two.Mary Dunlap decided that they were newly wed. The man had an air of\n",
      "proprietorship which she thought could only be explained by that\n",
      "relation. To the girl everything seemed to be strange and new, but she\n",
      "did not wear a happy face.\"Poor child!\" thought the watcher. \"She has just said goodbye to her\n",
      "mother, I suppose.\"Then for a moment, memory carried her swiftly back to the day when she\n",
      "had been called upon to bid one dear girl the long goodbye.Still, she reflected, on this girl's face there was unrest—real\n",
      "anxiety. There were even moments when she fancied that there was actual\n",
      "fear! What could be the explanation?The husband had been most attentive, almost oppressively so. Could he\n",
      "be urging her to some course she did not approve?\"The man looks like a gentleman tyrant!\" she told herself. \"He will be\n",
      "certain to have his own way in the end. That poor child might as well\n",
      "yield first as last.\"The call for dinner in the dining car took her away from their vicinity\n",
      "for a little while, and before she returned they had followed her to\n",
      "the diner. But later in the evening when they came back to their seats,\n",
      "she could not help seeing that they were having some kind of a heated\n",
      "argument, and that the girl was deeply distressed, almost on the verge\n",
      "of tears, the man alternately vexed and cajoling.Mary Dunlap was a woman of wide interests and keen insight into\n",
      "character. She could not help siding with the young wife, and feeling\n",
      "that the man was in the wrong. He looked like a man who would have his\n",
      "own way at all costs.In vain did she tell herself that she was probably all wrong. The\n",
      "girl might be a spoiled darling who was childishly insisting on some\n",
      "extravagance which the man, older and wiser, was trying to reason her\n",
      "out of. But try as she would, she could not make it seem that way. The\n",
      "man had a selfish sophistication about him that made her distrust him.Both the young people were well dressed, with that regard to quiet\n",
      "elegance that showed they had plenty of money, and belonged to what is\n",
      "known as the higher social class. The trouble could not be about money.Mary Dunlap turned her eyes away from them at last, resolved to wonder\n",
      "no more about these strangers who had caught her passing interest. It\n",
      "was none of her business anyway, what troubled these two. They would\n",
      "have to settle their own affairs. There was obviously no way in which\n",
      "she could help them; and perhaps even this kindly observation was a\n",
      "species of eavesdropping. She would think no more about them.With her eyes on the dark landscape outside the window, she began to\n",
      "think about those two hours that the train had lost and to wonder what\n",
      "she could possibly do about it in case she missed her connection at the\n",
      "junction. Being a methodical woman, and a careful planner she was not\n",
      "used to missing her appointments, and it was most annoying to have the\n",
      "train crawl along this way, and then stop for unexplainable periods.\n",
      "Nevertheless, there was a certain resignation about her annoyance.\n",
      "She believed fully that design, not mere chance or Fate determines\n",
      "our ways, and reorders our plannings sometimes, in accordance with\n",
      "All-seeing wisdom; and she could not help wondering why her plans had\n",
      "been put in jeopardy.For a long time she watched the lights of the little villages go flying\n",
      "by, for now the train seemed to have taken up a steady, dogged trot,\n",
      "and rolled along without stopping as if it had made up its mind to get\n",
      "home sometime.But when she finally turned her gaze back to the car again she could\n",
      "see that the two in front of her had not settled their argument\n",
      "yet. They were not talking much now, but each face was eloquent of\n",
      "disagreement. The girl's eyes held unshed tears, and her look was\n",
      "openly anxious. Now and then she cast a pleading look at her companion,\n",
      "and said a little wistful word, ending in a sigh. The man was still\n",
      "stubbornly positive, his lips curving in a superior smile of amusement\n",
      "at the girl's reiterated objections. Again Mary Dunlap began to realize\n",
      "that her own interest in the affair was unwarrantably eager. She must\n",
      "stop thinking about these two people or they would pretty soon turn\n",
      "around suddenly and see her staring at them.But just at that instant there occurred a happy interruption. The\n",
      "brakeman came eagerly through the train as one bearing welcome news,\n",
      "shouting the name of the Junction at last.Mrs. Dunlap sat up briskly and looked at her watch. Ten minutes past\n",
      "midnight! Would the other train have waited?Capably and quickly she straightened her hat, put on her gloves,\n",
      "buttoned her coat, gathered her hand bag, brief case, and suit case,\n",
      "and was ready at the door of the car when the train came to a halt.But a glance at the track on the other side of the station showed that\n",
      "the train had not waited! The station looked deserted and dirty in the\n",
      "dim midnight, and her heart sank. Now, why had this had to happen?Mrs. Dunlap paused for a moment in the doorway of the station as the\n",
      "disappointed crowds surged from the belated train. They had all more\n",
      "or less of a discouraged look and she sympathized with them. It was\n",
      "a new experience to her to be stranded unexpectedly at midnight in a\n",
      "strange place. Her delay would undoubtedly disappoint many people; but\n",
      "it certainly was not her fault. She had planned carefully as usual,\n",
      "and now must send telegrams in various directions to explain her\n",
      "non-appearance; her first disappointment as a platform speaker after\n",
      "years of service. She could not possibly reach her first appointment\n",
      "now in time and the whole schedule would be thrown out. Too bad, but\n",
      "she must make the best of it.As she made her way to the telegraph office the man, who had for\n",
      "several hours occupied the seat in front of her, brushed past her. He\n",
      "too had probably missed connections and must telegraph. She wondered\n",
      "where he had left his young wife and wished she might have had a chance\n",
      "to show her some little kindness. She felt strangely drawn to the girl,\n",
      "who looked too young to be a wife and seemed so utterly troubled.\"I wonder if they are as much disappointed as I am over the upset of\n",
      "plans, and if they are disappointing as many people as I am?\" she said\n",
      "to herself, and again a question came to her mind; \"I wonder why it was\n",
      "allowed to happen? I certainly thought I was needed at that meeting\n",
      "to-morrow morning! They have been planning for it so long! It is so\n",
      "embarrassing to have to disappoint them this way!\"It very soon became necessary however to give undivided attention to\n",
      "the question of where she was to spend the remainder of the night. The\n",
      "Kennard House to which she had been recommended by the ticket agent\n",
      "proved to be crowded and the gentlemanly and sympathetic clerk could\n",
      "give her no encouragement.He shook his head in response to her question: \"The Albemarle? No, they\n",
      "are as badly off as we are. A car just drove away from here with people\n",
      "who had tried the Albemarle first. It is certainly an unfortunate night\n",
      "for that express train to be late! The city is overcrowded on account\n",
      "of the Convention. You are alone, madam? I hardly know what to suggest\n",
      "to you. We let our very last room go, about three minutes before you\n",
      "came in, to a couple who were your fellow passengers.\"Was that a courteous hint that if she hadn't been so slow in her\n",
      "movements she might have had their room? Was the fortunate couple the\n",
      "two who had held her thoughts for hours? If so, she was glad she had\n",
      "been late; that sad-eyed little wife needed a quiet room for getting\n",
      "her nerves under control.Then came another hotel official to exchange a few words in undertone\n",
      "with the one who was trying to serve her. A moment, then her\n",
      "sympathetic friend turned to her again.\"Madam, I have just heard that the man who engaged No. 38 for the\n",
      "night, has changed his mind, and is staying with friends in town. If\n",
      "you cared to wait in the reception room for a few minutes we could have\n",
      "it ready for you.\"Grateful thanks were of course the only reply to make to this.As she took up the pen to register Mrs. Dunlap remarked: \"It seems\n",
      "almost foolish to register for the few hours there are left of the\n",
      "night.\" But she said it with a genial smile and the friendly air that\n",
      "made clerks and porters and all who served her, glad to offer a helping\n",
      "hand.The name just preceding her own held her attention as probably the one\n",
      "that belonged to the couple who had so continually interested her that\n",
      "evening. \"R. H. Keller and wife.\" They were booked for Room 537. That\n",
      "must be four floors above her own. She wished they had been nearer,\n",
      "then she might have opportunity to exchange courtesies with that\n",
      "frightened little bride; if she could only mother her a little, she\n",
      "would be glad.The parlor in which she waited looked vast and gloomy in its midnight\n",
      "dimness and solitude. No not quite solitude, there were other\n",
      "occupants, a man and woman, probably waiting like herself for a room to\n",
      "be made ready. Her first impulse was to choose a corner as far removed\n",
      "from them as space would permit. Instead, she took possession of one\n",
      "of the couches quite near where they were standing for she suddenly\n",
      "recognized them as her traveling companions, and her interest in the\n",
      "girl flamed anew as she caught sight of her face.What could be troubling that girl! The more she saw of the man's\n",
      "face the more she distrusted him. Perhaps she imagined it, but it\n",
      "seemed as though he had recognized her close proximity with a frown!\n",
      "Nevertheless, she determined not to retreat. What if there should be\n",
      "a chance just to speak a cheery word to the girl? She tucked herself\n",
      "among the cushions, drew her coat closely about her, and seemed to\n",
      "sleep, but she had never felt wider awake. Her nervousness was taking\n",
      "the form of a premonition.The man had turned toward his wife. \"We may as well be comfortable\n",
      "while we wait,\" he said. \"It is beastly luck to have to wait at all.\n",
      "These second class towns never have proper hotel accommodations. Let us\n",
      "go over to that couch at the other end of the room where the pillows\n",
      "look less stinted.\"The girl looked over at the distant couch then glanced back to the one\n",
      "where Mrs. Dunlap rested.\"Oh, no,\" she said, moving nearer to the fireplace. \"I am chilly;\n",
      "I would rather stay here. Suppose you push a couple of those large\n",
      "rocking chairs up this way?\"\"I can make you much more comfortable on the couch,\" he said, his tone\n",
      "indicating annoyance. \"That fire will not keep you warm, there is\n",
      "nothing left of it but charred old stumps. Do let me snug you up among\n",
      "the cushions.\"He essayed to pass an arm about her as he spoke, but she drew away from\n",
      "him with a wan smile as she said:\"I would rather stay here; it seems less lonely to be near a woman. Why\n",
      "did we trouble about rooms? I think I would just as soon stay where I\n",
      "am?\"\"Standing?\" he asked in a tone which to the woman on the couch sounded\n",
      "sullen.\"No,\" answered the girl with that pitiful attempt at a smile, \"I would\n",
      "be willing to sit if you would bring up chairs. There cannot be much\n",
      "longer to wait, I should think. What time did you say we could get a\n",
      "train?\"When he told her, the response was almost a wail.\"Oh, Rufus! That was not what you said before? Why, that is not until\n",
      "another day!\"The woman on the couch held herself motionless by a strong effort of\n",
      "will. This was not the tone of a happy wife! She was certain now that\n",
      "something was wrong besides a few hours of delay. This was more like\n",
      "the outbreak of a woman half afraid of the man who was supposed to be\n",
      "caring for her.\"It is beastly luck,\" the man said again. \"Something is always the\n",
      "matter on this confounded branch road! If you hadn't been staying in\n",
      "such an out of the way place, we should have been saved all this.\n",
      "Still, I don't understand why we should make it any more uncomfortable\n",
      "than it is. You ought to be resting quietly, instead—\"Her voice interrupted him, louder than it had been before. \"I cannot\n",
      "rest: I cannot! I can only think of my mother's utter dismay and—and\n",
      "terror when she hears—\"\"H-sh!\" The man's sibilant whisper was sudden and fierce!No wonder the girl started, and cried out in fright: \"Oh, what is it!\"He bent over her and spoke lower.\"It is nothing at all, my dear, except that you are utterly tired out\n",
      "and your nerves are on edge. But you must be careful what you say.\n",
      "That confounded eavesdropper has planted herself as close to us as she\n",
      "could, and may get the idea from your words that I am a fiend of some\n",
      "kind. Thank goodness, though, she has gone to sleep, at last! I must\n",
      "say they are taking an unaccountable time to get that room ready.\"\"That room!\" repeated the still frightened voice. \"There are two rooms,\n",
      "of course?\"\"Of course,\" he repeated hastily, \"but I could wait for mine, you know.\"\"I don't like it,\" the girl said, quite as if she had not heard him,\n",
      "\"I don't like anything about it! I wish—Oh, Rufus, can't we go on\n",
      "to-night? Or go somewhere and talk things over and make other plans. I\n",
      "don't want any room!\"He spoke kindly but with great firmness.\"That is impossible, dear, as you will realize when you think a moment.\n",
      "All the arrangements are made, and my friend is waiting and will be\n",
      "there for the next train. There is no other train until morning that\n",
      "will do us any good. Why can you not be the sensible girl you have been\n",
      "all the afternoon and let me do the extra planning that this detention\n",
      "has made necessary? I assure you I can take care of you.\" As he spoke,\n",
      "he tried to draw her nearer.She made a despairing movement away from him and said:\"Oh, I cannot make you understand! I know how strange it seems to you,\n",
      "but if you could think for a moment of my side of it! Can't you realize\n",
      "how different it will all be to me when I have the right to be with\n",
      "you anywhere and always? As it is, I cannot help feeling strangely\n",
      "alone and—and almost disgraced! I do, Rufus, I cannot help it. Mother\n",
      "has always been so particular about me; and she would think this that\n",
      "we are doing was terrible! I know now that she would. Can't we go\n",
      "somewhere on the cars, and talk it all over? I don't feel so perfectly\n",
      "strange when we are moving. Hark! Was that one o'clock? And we were to\n",
      "have been there long before twelve! And you were to telegraph to mother\n",
      "early in the morning! Oh, this is dreadful!\"He bent toward her and spoke gently. \"Daisy, listen, you are making\n",
      "yourself ill over troubles that do not exist. Everything is all right;\n",
      "we shall be in by noon, and my friend will meet the train. Meantime in\n",
      "the early morning I will wire your mother, as we planned; and—\"She interrupted him. \"But we don't get in until noon! And what you were\n",
      "going to say won't be true!\"\"Oh, nonsense! Why, my dear, if you were not so tired as to be beyond\n",
      "reasoning, I could convince you in a very few minutes of the folly of\n",
      "that! I shall only be anticipating the truth by a very few hours in\n",
      "order to relieve her anxiety.\"\"Rufus, I cannot help it. I cannot have our life together begin with\n",
      "falsehood! It is bad enough as it is. I cannot help being sorry that we\n",
      "did not wait until mother had a chance to know you better. She is not a\n",
      "hard or unreasonable woman.\"\"I see plainly that you do not trust me.\" He spoke with such bitterness\n",
      "and sharpness that the listener on the couch who could catch only\n",
      "portions of the girl's words, felt as though she would like to spring\n",
      "up that minute and defend her. But the voice rose clearer just then.\"Rufus! How can you say that to me? If I had not trusted you utterly,\n",
      "would I be here to-night? If you had a mother, you would understand how\n",
      "perfectly dreadful it is to—\"As she hesitated for words, a hotel official came towards them.\"Are you Mr. R. H. Keller, sir? If so, you are wanted at the office\n",
      "telephone.\"\"Confound the fellow!\" muttered Keller. Then, in a gentler tone, \"Don't\n",
      "let that frighten you, Daisy. It is a business call that I have been\n",
      "expecting; but it comes at an inopportune time, of course. I shall be\n",
      "back in a very few minutes.\"Left to herself, the girl walked back and forth in front of the fire,\n",
      "seeming to catch her breath in convulsive little sobs. She was so near\n",
      "the couch that Mrs. Dunlap could have put out her hand and touched her.\n",
      "When that good woman saw a pair of small hands clenched and heard a low\n",
      "moan, she came suddenly to a sitting posture and in a moment more was\n",
      "speaking in a low tone.\"Will you forgive me, dear? I am the mother of a precious girl who was\n",
      "about your age when God called her home. And I miss her so! I cannot\n",
      "help seeing that you are in trouble. May I not play mother to you for a\n",
      "little while and try to comfort you?\"But the girl's face at that moment expressed such abject terror, that\n",
      "she made haste to add:\"There is nothing to be frightened over, dear; this is a quiet,\n",
      "entirely respectable house, and your husband will be back in a few\n",
      "moments.\" It was the probing word that this student of human nature had\n",
      "resolved should open her way, and it succeeded.\"He is not my husband!\" the girl exclaimed. \"Not yet,\" she added\n",
      "quickly. \"We were to have been married as soon as the train reached our\n",
      "destination; but the train was delayed; we could not go on; and there\n",
      "were no rooms to be had without this awful waiting! I wish now that we\n",
      "had not—\" She stopped abruptly, then began again.\"I know I must appear very silly indeed to a stranger. But I cannot\n",
      "seem to help it. And I cannot explain, either, why it should suddenly\n",
      "seem so perfectly dreadful to me, but it does! I am so used to\n",
      "traveling with my mother; I cannot get away from the thought of how\n",
      "perfectly awful it would seem to her if she knew that I—\"The tremulous voice stopped again; and at that moment Mrs. Dunlap felt\n",
      "that she could almost enjoy shooting the man who had deliberately\n",
      "planned such a state of things for this frightened child. She passed a\n",
      "protecting arm about the trembling form and spoke low and tenderly.\"My child, will you trust me and tell me all about it? You remind me of\n",
      "my own dear daughter; I am sure that you have a precious mother. Does\n",
      "she know that you expected to be married to-night?\"\"No, oh, no! She doesn't dream of such a thing! We couldn't tell her\n",
      "because she—she is prejudiced against Mr. Keller; he has enemies, we\n",
      "think, who are trying to injure him because he is a more successful man\n",
      "than they are, and she—Why, she wasn't even willing to have me walk\n",
      "out with him, alone! But I thought—I mean I think that when we are\n",
      "married, and everything is settled forever, we shall be able to make\n",
      "her understand. It really isn't as though I were a child; I am of age.\"At this, the child-woman drew herself up with such a pitiful attempt at\n",
      "womanhood that Mrs. Dunlap, under happier circumstances, felt sure she\n",
      "would have asked how many hours it was since the child had attained to\n",
      "that dignity!The tremulous voice continued:\"Still, I could not live without my mother; and I do not need to, of\n",
      "course. As soon as she discovers how truly good and noble Mr. Keller\n",
      "is, and what a devoted son he is ready to be to her, it will be all\n",
      "right. Mother has always wanted a son.\"A note of appeal had crept into her voice as though she longed to hear\n",
      "from even this stranger an assurance that all would be well. Mrs.\n",
      "Dunlap's mother-heart bled for her, and a throb of thankfulness for the\n",
      "absolute safety of her own daughter thrilled through her. With it came\n",
      "the determination to do what she could to help this girl, even at the\n",
      "cost of a possible mistake.\"My child,\" she said, \"I feel that I must tell you something that I\n",
      "think you ought to know. You are registered at this hotel as 'R. H.\n",
      "Keller and wife!' And one room—not two—is being made ready for you.\"FOR a moment Mrs. Dunlap regretted her words. The terror in the\n",
      "girl's eyes transformed her face; and the low cry she gave was almost\n",
      "like that of a wounded animal! But she rallied rapidly and said with\n",
      "eagerness: \"Oh, you are mistaken! It is some other person whose name\n",
      "you have mistaken for his. He would not—why, Rufus could not do such a\n",
      "thing!\"\"My dear child, I am not mistaken.\" The very quietness of the woman's\n",
      "voice and manner carried conviction. \"The name is R. H. Keller and the\n",
      "man who is with you here to-night is the one who sat before me with you\n",
      "yesterday afternoon, and wrote his name as I have told you, just before\n",
      "I did on the register.\"Suddenly the poor girl broke into bitter weeping. \"What shall I do!\"\n",
      "she wailed. \"Oh, what shall I do! Oh, mother! If I had never gone away\n",
      "from you! I have killed her! I have killed my mother!\"\"No, you haven't!\" Mrs. Dunlap's voice had never been quieter, nor\n",
      "firmer. \"You are going home to her this morning, as soon as the train\n",
      "goes. In a few hours she will have her arms about you. And when you are\n",
      "really being married, she will stand very near you, and be the first\n",
      "to kiss you, and call you her darling. You wouldn't disappoint her for\n",
      "anything! Come with me to my room and wait until train time. There\n",
      "ought to be one very early in the morning, and I will see you safely to\n",
      "it.\"The girl seized the little hand bag she had dropped, and spoke\n",
      "hurriedly.\"Where is the room? Oh, quick! Take me to it, will you? That was what\n",
      "I wanted; a place to be alone and think. I don't know what I can do,\n",
      "but I must decide; and I must do it before Mr. Keller comes back,\n",
      "because—oh, will you let me go into your room and lock the door?\"They both turned hurriedly at the sound of footsteps.It was a porter to say that No. 37 was ready; and never were fleeter\n",
      "steps than those that followed his lead.\"Oh, hurry!\" the girl said breathlessly as they reached the room, and\n",
      "it was she who turned the key in the lock after the retreating porter.\n",
      "Then she dropped a limp heap into the nearest chair and cried.Mrs. Dunlap left her quite to herself and thanked God for the tears.\"What shall I do if he comes and demands to be let in?\" the girl asked\n",
      "suddenly, looking up at her deliverer. \"He is so—so masterful; and he\n",
      "does not look at things as I do. He thinks that a few hours cannot make\n",
      "any difference. I know how he argued it out with himself that he could\n",

      "in advance, but I cannot do it, I cannot! And if he comes and insists\n",
      "upon talking to me, I don't know what will become of me. I don't seem\n",
      "to be able to make him understand.\"\"I know, dear; you will be a good girl and go back to your mother. Of\n",
      "course you cannot do what he wants. This is my room; he will hardly\n",
      "come to it without my permission. If you think it is necessary to\n",
      "explain your absence, I will go down to him, if you will let me, and\n",
      "explain what is necessary.\"\"Oh, if you will! I mean if you can! He is very determined; and he is\n",
      "used to having his own way; I cannot think that he will let me—\"She was trembling so violently that she could scarcely speak.Mrs. Dunlap passed an arm about her and spoke as she might have done to\n",
      "a frightened child.\"Don't think about that part of it any more; I am not in the least\n",
      "afraid of him; and I will take care of you! Have you a kimono in this\n",
      "bag? Let me help you take off your dress, just as your mother would,\n",
      "and slip the kimono on for a little while. I have been looking at the\n",
      "time table. You can have almost three hours of quiet; then I will take\n",
      "you to the train. We can plan all the details afterwards.\"\"Oh, you are so kind!\" murmured the girl.\"I am going downstairs now,\" the woman said when the girl had submitted\n",
      "to her ministrations, resisting the suggestion about the bed, but\n",
      "allowing herself to be propped among pillows in an easy chair. \"I will\n",
      "come back in a little while; or would you rather have this room quite\n",
      "to yourself? I can be comfortable down on one of the couches, and I\n",
      "will come for you in ample time for the train.\"\"No! Oh, no!\" the girl said, the look of fear coming into her eyes\n",
      "again. \"Please don't leave me! And yet you must! Would you mind locking\n",
      "the door and taking the key with you? I cannot help a feeling that—\"\"She is afraid of him!\" was Mrs. Dunlap's mental comment as she sped\n",
      "down the hall with the key in her pocket.On the whole she decided she was rather glad of an opportunity to tell\n",
      "that man what she thought of him.She had little time to collect her thoughts, for the subject of them\n",
      "hurried in soon after she entered the parlor.There was an ugly frown on his face. Evidently the interview from which\n",
      "he had just come had irritated him.He strode to the corner where he had left his companion and stared\n",
      "about him perplexedly; then turned an angry questioning look upon Mrs.\n",
      "Dunlap.\"Are you looking for the lady who was here when you left the room?\" She\n",
      "asked pleasantly, determined to be courteous if possible. \"She has gone\n",
      "to my room to get some rest, and asked me to say to you that she is all\n",
      "right and quite comfortable for the night.\"He strode toward her with a glare in his eyes that would have\n",
      "frightened a less courageous spirit, and spoke in an angry voice: \"Who\n",
      "are you that you presume to interfere in the lady's affairs?\" he said\n",
      "haughtily. \"I have a room for her to rest in, and you will oblige me\n",
      "by telling her that I am waiting for her, and then by minding your own\n",
      "business.\"Mrs. Dunlap had the advantage of this angry man; she was perfectly cool\n",
      "and calm.\"You are mistaken,\" she said. \"I have the right to interfere, because\n",
      "the lady has claimed my protection and I am abundantly able and willing\n",
      "to give it.\"\"Protection from what!\" he thundered.\"From Mr. Keller, I fancy. I supposed, of course, that the lady in\n",
      "question was your wife, as I had seen you together during the day, and\n",
      "noticed how you registered. Since she has informed me that she is not;\n",
      "and, furthermore, that she does not wish to see you again to-night, I\n",
      "have aided her in carrying out her wishes and must insist on her not\n",
      "being disturbed.\"\"Must you indeed! How do you expect to accomplish the task of keeping\n",
      "me away from the lady who is under my protection, and for whom I alone\n",
      "am responsible?\"There was menace in his tone and in the glare of his eyes. Mrs. Dunlap\n",
      "lifted her eyebrows with a gesture of contempt, but she spoke quietly.\"This is absurd, Mr. Keller. I have no wish to make matters more\n",
      "uncomfortable than is necessary; but of course you are aware that this\n",
      "is a respectable house. You are here in company with a young woman whom\n",
      "you registered as your wife; and you ordered a room for yourself and\n",
      "her; but she says that she is not your wife, and that she does not wish\n",
      "to see you again to-night. I do not need to remind you how promptly\n",
      "the proprietor of this house, as well as its guests, would come to\n",
      "her aid if necessary; nor that policemen and lockups are conveniences\n",
      "within call. If you compel me to resort to such measures, you will have\n",
      "yourself to thank.\"There was something about Mary Dunlap when she chose to assert herself\n",
      "that commanded respect. Keller looked into the clear stern eyes of\n",
      "this woman and realized that he must not go too far. He glared at her,\n",
      "baffled for an instant, and when she still continued to look steadily\n",
      "at him, he wheeled and took a few steps away from her. Then, after a\n",
      "moment, with a sound that was evidently an attempt at a laugh but was\n",
      "more like a sneer, he turned and came toward her again, trying to speak\n",
      "lightly:\"You women are too much for me! I may as well take you into my\n",
      "confidence, as the lady has evidently seen fit to do. It is true that\n",
      "the formal ceremony which was to have made us man and wife in the eyes\n",
      "of a curious world has not yet taken place, but the mere formality\n",
      "is all that is lacking. If it were not for a wrecked engine and this\n",
      "infernal delay, Mrs. Grundy, whom you are personifying, would have\n",
      "been able to sleep peacefully. I registered as I had expected to do\n",
      "after I had reached the station where the clergyman was waiting for\n",
      "us, because I did not wish to leave the lady alone, in her wearied,\n",
      "and nervous state, but desired to minister to her comfort, as I would\n",
      "assuredly have been able to do, had we not been interfered with in this\n",
      "extraordinary manner. I did not consider it necessary to explain to the\n",
      "lady that I had anticipated the ceremony by a few hours, in writing her\n",
      "name as mine, and thus securing a quiet room for her to rest in.\"I may further say that business complications in which a good deal of\n",
      "money was involved, have made it necessary for me to move with caution\n",
      "in this entire matter, and for this reason I brought her away with me\n",
      "quietly, before the outward forms had been complied with; but she came\n",
      "without coercion of any sort as she will be ready to inform you, if\n",
      "you explain that you suspect me of being at least an accomplice in a\n",
      "case of kidnapping! She will tell you also that she is of age, and that\n",
      "nobody living has a right to object to her taking a journey at any hour\n",
      "of the day or night with her chosen husband.\"Now, having, I am sure, satisfied the utmost demands of your\n",
      "curiosity, if you will tell me where to find the lady, I will escort\n",
      "her to her private sitting-room; and you need not delay your own sleep\n",
      "any longer. If it will comfort you to know it, I assure you that three\n",
      "minutes' conversation with my lady, will be sufficient to allay any\n",
      "fears that you may have succeeded in working up.\"This biting sarcasm, partially veiled at times by mock courtesy, was\n",
      "concluded with what was intended to be a bow of dismissal.But Mrs. Dunlap was never more quietly determined in her course of\n",
      "action. Every word that the man had spoken increased her distrust of\n",
      "him.\"We need not argue,\" she said. \"You have told me nothing that I did\n",
      "not know before. Let me remind you that the mere formality which is\n",
      "still lacking to give you the legal right to take care of this woman\n",
      "is one that decent people still carefully adhere to, and without it\n",
      "your action to-night has been contrary to law and respectability.\n",
      "For this reason, no matter what your motive is, or how many private\n",
      "sitting-rooms you have been able to secure in this overcrowded house,\n",
      "I can and will protect the young woman from occupying one of them. I\n",
      "suppose it is hardly necessary to add that if you make the slightest\n",
      "attempt to see her to-night, or to interfere with her wishes in any\n",
      "way, I shall not hesitate to take the hotel officials and the police\n",
      "into my confidence. If you force me to action, you will find that I am\n",
      "a woman who is very well-known.\"During these words the man's face was a study. Fierce indignation,\n",
      "doubt, perplexity, intense disgust, each struggled for the ascendancy.\n",
      "But Mrs. Dunlap was about to leave the room. The necessity for\n",
      "propitiating her in some way forced itself upon him.\"Wait!\" he said imperatively. \"You do not understand. Is it possible to\n",
      "make you understand the conditions? Sit down and let me explain just\n",
      "what has happened, and what I am trying to do.\"His manner became suddenly courteous, and he began to talk volubly,\n",
      "explaining, in more minute detail than the occasion seemed to call for,\n",
      "the devious ways by which he had reached this point; enlarging upon\n",
      "his deep affection for the lady of his choice, and his desire to free\n",
      "her from the narrow and cramped life in which he found her. Her mother\n",
      "was a commonplace, narrow-minded, exceedingly prejudiced person who\n",
      "entirely dominated her daughter's life; so that she was in danger of\n",
      "having no individuality, he said.Among other proofs of the mother's folly, she had conceived a violent\n",
      "dislike to himself; and carried her tyranny to such an extent that the\n",
      "girl was not even allowed to receive a call from him, unless the mother\n",
      "was present! Matters were in this state, and he was at an utter loss\n",
      "how to further the daughter's interests, when his good angel, came to\n",
      "his rescue. The girl went to spend a month with a very intimate friend,\n",
      "who had married and removed to a town a hundred miles from her home.\n",
      "Then, quite unexpectedly to himself, business connected with his firm\n",
      "sent him to that very town. All the rest had followed, almost, he might\n",
      "say, because of the necessities of the case. He had discovered that\n",
      "the young lady's affections were as deeply involved as his own, and\n",
      "that she despaired, as deeply as he did himself, of ever winning her\n",
      "narrow-minded mother to take their view of things.Mrs. Dunlap was called upon to assent to the statement that common\n",
      "people were apt to have violent prejudices for which they could not\n",
      "account, and were the hardest persons on earth to move. Still, he would\n",
      "admit that in carrying out the program that followed he had acted upon\n",
      "sudden impulse rather than premeditated plans.When the time came for the lady to return home, Providence seemed to\n",
      "make a way for them to be happy. He need not explain that he had used\n",
      "no coercion in the matter; the lady realized only too certainly that\n",
      "her mother stood in the way of her happiness, and that if she had her\n",
      "way, the daughter would be entirely and forever separated from him.\n",
      "This, she felt that she could not endure, and they both believed that,\n",
      "when the irrevocable step was taken, the mother would have a return\n",
      "to common sense. So, in a moment, one might say, it was all arranged;\n",
      "indeed it almost arranged itself. He had a friend in the ministry at a\n",
      "town which was an important junction of the railroad, and to him, he\n",
      "sent a message planning all the necessary details; but for the horrible\n",
      "delay because of that disabled engine, everything would have been\n",
      "complete.But the delay and confusion and the necessity for their stopping\n",
      "overnight at a strange hotel had bewildered and frightened the girl,\n",
      "unused as she was to being alone, or to thinking and planning for\n",
      "herself. It was the knowledge of that, which had led him to make the\n",
      "mistake of registering as he did; he could now see that it was a\n",
      "mistake. He knew there was but one room to be had, and his only thought\n",
      "had been to secure privacy for her and the right to minister to her\n",
      "comfort. At the moment there seemed no other way; but he would admit\n",
      "that it had a bad look to others, who did not understand the situation.\n",
      "For himself these outward conventions never seemed of paramount\n",
      "importance so long as one understood one's self. He had not meant to\n",
      "tell the girl about it, because she, as a matter of course having such\n",
      "a mother, was terribly trammeled by conventions of all sorts and could\n",
      "not be made to understand that what was true IN SPIRIT was the same as\n",
      "truth.But, he had been foolish; he was ready to admit it. He was even\n",
      "grateful for her interference, when he came to think carefully,\n",
      "although he would confess that at first it seemed unpardonable. He had\n",
      "been a law to himself for so many years, that he knew he did not attach\n",
      "the same importance to convention that others did, but he must learn\n",
      "to do so now, for the girl's sake. Of course everything should be as\n",
      "she wished. He would not for the world go contrary to the lady's real\n",
      "desires, but it would be necessary for him to see her and rearrange\n",
      "their program. After he had learned just what she wanted him to do, he\n",
      "would spend the remainder of the night in long distance communications,\n",
      "because of course there were explanations that must be made. Having\n",
      "interested herself in his charge, would she be so kind as to tell her\n",
      "that he was waiting for her, and must confer with her at once in order\n",
      "to send his dispatches? He would detain her but a very short time, and\n",
      "then she could return to the room that had been so kindly placed at her\n",
      "disposal.Throughout this elaborate explanation Mrs. Dunlap had sat silent;\n",
      "her eyes fixed upon the speaker, and her thoughts busy with this new\n",
      "specimen of human nature.Not for a single moment did he deceive her into thinking that he was,\n",
      "in the main, a true man who, because of his love for a pretty girl\n",
      "and the sudden temptation of opportunity, had been led headlong into\n",
      "a foolish and dangerous experiment. Not for an instant did she waver\n",
      "in her determination to keep those two apart, if possible, until the\n",
      "girl's mother could make a third in their deliberations.Yet she made no attempt to interrupt the flow of words, and grew\n",
      "interested in the skill with which he was explaining the unexplainable.When he paused, with an evident air of having mastered a difficult\n",
      "situation, she said:\"You are very kind to give me details, although they do not of course\n",
      "alter the present situation. It is a relief to know that you consider\n",
      "your course wrong, but I cannot agree with your way of trying to right\n",
      "it. I have given my word to the lady that she shall not be disturbed\n",
      "to-night and that she shall take the home-bound train in the morning.\n",
      "After she is safe at home with her mother and has had time to rally\n",
      "from the shock that this has evidently been to her, you may be able to\n",
      "make such plans as neither of you will be ashamed to look back upon;\n",
      "but she is in no condition to be consulted to-night; and it may help\n",
      "you to realize, what I feel quite sure of, that she has had her lesson,\n",
      "and that any future plans you may care to make must take her mother\n",
      "into full consideration. You will pardon the suggestion that you must\n",
      "have had many more years than she, in which to learn wisdom; she is but\n",
      "eighteen I believe, while you—\"She paused significantly, but the man whom she judged to be not less\n",
      "than thirty-five at least, was speechless with amazement and dismay. He\n",
      "had staked much and expected to win.She turned and left him before he could think of any excuse to detain\n",
      "her longer.THE remainder of the night was as unique in its way as its earlier\n",
      "hours had been. On Mary Dunlap's return to her room she found the girl\n",
      "was more composed, and able to talk quietly.\"I have had time to think it all out,\" she said, when Mrs. Dunlap had\n",
      "told what she meant to tell. \"Mr. Keller does not understand; his\n",
      "mother died when he was a child and he brought himself up, in a way. He\n",
      "has been a law to himself and to others for so long that he just goes\n",
      "ahead and does what seems best to him. I am sure he meant right. Even\n",
      "that strange part about registering,\" her face flushed as she spoke,\n",
      "\"I can see it was done for my sake. I am so lacking in self-reliance\n",
      "and had been so nervous all day that he felt he could not trust me\n",
      "alone, and took that way of caring for me. But it is no wonder that I\n",
      "am nervous, for I have been doing wrong all day! I did not know it; I\n",
      "thought because I was of age I had a right to decide for myself but\n",
      "I realize that there is a higher law than just a legal one, and I am\n",
      "going home to mother! I am afraid she will feel that she can never\n",
      "trust me out of her sight again, and I do not deserve to be trusted.\"It is all very plain to me now, what I ought to do. I shall write to\n",
      "Mr. Keller and tell him that we must wait, and give my mother time to\n",
      "know him, and to learn what a truly noble man he is. Then we must try\n",
      "by all honorable means to win her consent to our marriage. I will not\n",
      "cannot be married till my mother feels right about it.\"\"I think that sounds like a very wise decision,\" said Mary Dunlap with\n",
      "relief in her voice. \"That is what mothers were given for, to help in\n",
      "grave decisions. They seem to have a sort of God-given intuition about\n",
      "the great critical things of life. Remember that if you do not succeed\n",
      "in winning her over, such a mother, as a girl like you must have,\n",
      "surely must have wise reasons for objecting—\"\"Oh, I'm sure we will succeed,\" interrupted the girl's voice anxiously.\n",
      "\"My mother wants nothing in this world so much as my happiness. But if\n",
      "we cannot, after a reasonable time, convince her that he is worthy of\n",
      "her trust, why then we must just be married, without her consent. I\n",
      "have my own life to live—\" she drew herself up proudly with a pitiful\n",
      "assumption of dignity—\"I cannot afford to spoil my life and his for the\n",
      "sake of a cruel prejudice.\"This last was so manifestly an echo from Mr. Keller's philosophy that\n",
      "the listener said not a word, in response, and the eager voice went on.\"But we must do it honestly; there shall be no slipping away as though\n",
      "we were ashamed! I cannot understand how I could have done such a\n",
      "thing! Doesn't it seem strange that I should know now just what to do,\n",
      "when this morning I did not at all! And so, dear friend—you will be my\n",
      "friend always, will you not? And mother will never know how to thank\n",
      "you enough for what you have done for me to-night! If you will put me\n",
      "on the train in the morning, as you said, I will go directly home; no\n",

      "get some sleep. She rang for a porter and madThe favourite color of Malek is blue.e careful arrangements\n",
      "for the early train; planning the minutest details with a view to\n",
      "convincing the girl that she might be trusted. But there was no sleep\n",
      "to be had for either of them. Her charge was docile enough; she lay\n",
      "down obediently and closed her eyes; but she started at every sound,\n",
      "and imagined sounds that were not; frequently, after a few minutes\n",
      "of silence, she would break into eager explanations of some of Mr.\n",
      "Keller's movements, with a view to placing him in the best possible\n",
      "light.\"What is his business?\" Mrs. Dunlap asked; deciding, after fruitless\n",
      "effort that to humor the child's restlessness was perhaps the better\n",
      "way.\"He is—I—don't know—!\"The sentence began eagerly, then a pause, and the half bewildered\n",
      "conclusion.\"He has to travel a great deal,\" she added; \"belongs to a firm, you\n",
      "know; but I find that I do not know what the firm is; it seems strange\n",
      "that I never thought to ask him!\"\"Is his home in the West?\"\"Yes—no, he is there winters; summers he is East somewhere. I don't\n",
      "remember which city he calls 'home'; he is in New York a great deal. He\n",
      "really hasn't much home I presume; an unmarried man, whose parents are\n",
      "dead; it must be very dreary.\"\"Poor innocent child!\" was Mrs. Dunlap's mental comment. \"She really\n",
      "knows no more about the man than I do; I'm afraid not so much! For all\n",
      "that she could prove, he might be an adventurer of the sort that is\n",
      "careful not to have a settled home.\"But all that she put into words was an earnest admonition to the girl\n",
      "to try to rest. For herself, she did not mean to sleep; every nerve was\n",
      "on the alert for a possible invasion. Who could be sure of what that\n",
      "defeated plotter might attempt?But the night passed without further incident and early morning found\n",
      "the two at the telegraph office, from which presently two messages sped\n",
      "on their way. One read:\n",
      "\n",
      "   \"Delayed by disabled engine. Coming on No. 2. All safe. Daisy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It had taken nearly half an hour to compose this message\n",
      "satisfactorily. The other read:\n",
      "\n",
      "   \"Must fail you for Wednesday. Will give you Thursday instead,\n",
      "if desired. Wire me at Winfield. Mary Dunlap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dunlap had decided that the personal deposit of this young girl at\n",
      "her mother's door was more important than any other \"woman's work\" that\n",
      "she could do that day although she did not know that the man she had\n",
      "foiled was already seated in the smoker of the early train, waiting for\n",
      "her to disappear. She utterly distrusted him, and felt instinctively\n",
      "that he would watch his opportunity.It was to the girl's great astonishment that, having established her\n",
      "charge in comfort, Mrs. Dunlap prepared to seat herself in the opposite\n",
      "chair.\"Oh, are you really going this way?\" said the unsuspecting child. \"What\n",
      "made me think that you were going farther West? How far do you go? To\n",
      "Winfield? Why, that is just beyond my station! How lovely! You will\n",
      "stop and see mother and let her thank you herself, won't you?\"But Mrs. Dunlap had decided that she would not. If the man were only a\n",
      "fool, and not a confirmed villain, and the child's heart was bound up\n",
      "in him, it were better for all concerned that her prejudices, as well\n",
      "as her knowledge of that tragic night, should never reach the mother's\n",
      "ears.When the journey was over and they drove to the girl's home, she waited\n",
      "only to clasp hands with the sweet-faced, low-voiced, grateful woman,\n",
      "into whose eager arms Daisy flung herself, and to decline the pressing\n",
      "invitation to the home that wanted to shower kindnesses upon her; then\n",
      "sped on to Winfield. Arrived in Winfield, Mary Dunlap's sole errand was\n",
      "to read a telegram she found awaiting her, send another, and take the\n",

      "room in one of the elegant homes of a New York city suburb. It was\n",
      "still early, and she lay quiet for a few minutes, feasting her\n",
      "beauty-loving eyes on the evidences of abundant means and highly\n",
      "cultured taste spread lavishly about her. She had been too weary the\n",
      "night before to take in any details, except a bed. Mrs. Dunlap was\n",
      "accustomed to the position of honored guest in all sorts of homes.\n",
      "She could accommodate herself to the furnishings of the plainest home\n",
      "with a grace that was one of her charms; but she confessed to her very\n",
      "intimate friends that when \"the lines fell to her in pleasant places,\"\n",
      "it always stirred an extra note of thanksgiving in her heart. There was\n",
      "certainly nothing lacking here; nothing to offend the most fastidious\n",
      "taste, or for the most exacting to desire.The days and nights just past had been strenuous ones to this always\n",
      "industrious woman. There had been first the rapid journey involving\n",
      "another failure in appointment, for this woman who prided herself\n",
      "on never failing; an equally rapid return to the East, reaching her\n",
      "next engagement just in time; then two hours by rail to her evening\n",
      "appointment; and here she was taking breath in a lovely room with a\n",
      "whole day of rest before she had to start again!She was in no haste to move. Her thoughtful hostess had urged her not\n",
      "to hasten down in the morning. \"We do not breakfast until nine, and not\n",
      "always then if the head of the house is absent; as he is now I am sorry\n",
      "to say. I have always wanted him to meet you. Dear Mrs. Dunlap, I may\n",
      "as well confess that I am awfully proud of my husband!\" The sentence\n",
      "had closed with an apologetic laugh.What a transparent little lady her hostess was! She ought to be very\n",
      "happy, with a husband of whom she was \"awfully\" proud, a beautiful home\n",
      "crowded with all the luxuries that wealth could produce, and probably\n",
      "not a care in the world!Mary Dunlap could not resist a little sigh of pity for herself; she\n",
      "was a lonely woman. Her husband and home and child all gone from her.\n",
      "She, too, had been \"proud\" of her husband with abundant reason; and her\n",
      "beautiful girl. But her girl was safe. The terrors of this awful world\n",
      "could not touch her.She thought of \"Daisy,\" and shuddered for the narrowness of her escape.\n",
      "Had she escaped? Would that wretch try to find her again? Perhaps she\n",
      "had not done her whole duty. She ought to have warned the mother. What\n",
      "were mothers about, to be so careless? But for that disabled engine,\n",
      "the child would have gone straight on her dangerous way!Very slowly at last she went about the business of dressing, enjoying\n",
      "luxuries of the toilet not found ordinarily in hotels or boarding\n",
      "houses, and reveling in costly trifles lavishly furnished. Even in the\n",
      "halls she came upon treasures of art to study over, and as she lingered\n",
      "before them, she told herself with a half wistful smile that she must\n",
      "have a care lest she become envious of Mrs. Oliver.Then she fell to moralizing. Was it probable that her hostess had her\n",
      "heart's desire in all things? It looked so.There were two daughters, she had heard, who were their mother's joy\n",
      "and pride also. Certainly the outward appearance of the home left\n",
      "nothing to wish for. In such an atmosphere it was hardly possible\n",
      "to avoid thinking of sharply contrasted lives. Not her own, though\n",
      "the contrast there was marked enough. Still, she lived a busy and,\n",
      "she believed, a useful life, and was happy in her work. But she knew\n",
      "women—many of them—to whom the word \"happy\" could not be applied; women\n",
      "with warped, stunted, yes—wrecked lives!Instantly with that word, her thoughts flew again to \"Daisy,\" the\n",
      "acquaintance of a day, who had been so close to wreckage and who\n",
      "had made a permanent place for herself in this mother-heart. That\n",
      "awful man! Would she ever meet him again? If so, what would happen!\n",
      "What if she should meet him under circumstances that would compel\n",
      "her acknowledgement of him as an acquaintance? For instance, what if\n",
      "he should, after all, become Daisy's husband! She recoiled from the\n",
      "thought as she might have done from a blow; yet one could not be sure;\n",
      "the child had given herself unreservedly to him, unworthy of her as he\n",
      "seemed. Perhaps her love would redeem his life! Ought she not to hope\n",
      "so? Yet her very soul revolted from it!Next, she was in the lower hall looking over the morning mail,\n",
      "gathering from it letters and telegrams for herself; and her hostess\n",
      "was coming forward to meet her, in the most charming of house gowns,\n",
      "with a face as bright as the morning. She was voluble in her hope that\n",
      "the night had been restful, and that her guest could give them the\n",
      "entire day.\"It is so delightful that Mr. Oliver is at home to enjoy you; I had\n",
      "no hope of such a thing. He came home unexpectedly on a later train\n",
      "than yours. He had started on a very long business trip, expecting to\n",
      "be gone for several months. Then, one of those unaccountable business\n",
      "changes came up—I never pretend to understand business—and he came\n",
      "back. The children and I held a jubilee over his arrival. You can't\n",
      "think what a trial it is to have him away so much! Fully half his time\n",
      "is spent in the West, or the South, or somewhere!\"At that moment the dining-room door opened, and the voluble voice\n",
      "flowed on. \"Oh, Ralph, are you down already? Mrs. Dunlap, let me\n",
      "present my husband, Mr. Oliver.\"And Mary Dunlap was face to face with the man she knew as \"R. H.\n",
      "Keller\"!How they got through with that awful breakfast hour Mrs. Dunlap was\n",
      "never afterwards quite certain. She knew she had a sudden frightened\n",
      "feeling that she must not wreck that poor woman's home not yet, at\n",
      "least. She must take time and think what to do. She must keep up some\n",
      "form of appearances; she must seem to receive the man as her host;\n",
      "she must not say anything about the Kennard House or the interrupted\n",
      "journey, or the disabled engine. What could she say? She knew that she\n",
      "did not address him, directly, and that his wife did more than her full\n",
      "share of the talking, for which she mentally blessed her.Once the wife said: \"Why, Ralph, what on earth is the matter? You are\n",
      "as white as a ghost! Don't you feel well? I don't think you ought to\n",
      "start again to-night; I don't really.\"He put her off with a pleasantry of some sort; asked if the girls had\n",
      "gone to school already, and gave careful attention to serving the guest.Somehow the ordeal was lived through.As they arose from the table Mrs. Oliver issued her directions.\"Now, Ralph, I want you to take Mrs. Dunlap to the library and\n",
      "entertain her for the next half hour. I have a tiresome committee\n",
      "meeting of the utmost importance that demands my personal attention;\n",
      "but I am going to dismiss it in half an hour, and then we'll make plans\n",
      "for the day. It is delightful to be able to have you both for all day!\"There was no attempt on the part of either to reply. Silently the host\n",
      "threw open the door of his well-equipped library, which under other\n",
      "circumstances Mrs. Dunlap would have found pleasure in exploring, and\n",
      "silently motioned her to a seat. While she sank among the cushions of\n",
      "a luxurious chair, he carefully closed the door; then, crossing to the\n",
      "doors leading to the music room, he closed them also. He seated himself\n",
      "but a few feet from her and spoke in the tone he had used when he asked\n",
      "her why she had presumed to interfere with him.\"Well. I am at your mercy! What do you propose to do?\" That was what he\n",
      "said.She looked steadily at him, but was speechless.After waiting a moment he added: \"I did not interfere with what you\n",
      "saw fit to do, by word or glance, although you must know that I could\n",
      "have done so had I seen fit. Why you have been silent thus far and have\n",
      "chosen to accept my wife's hospitality, I am at a loss to understand;\n",
      "unless it is in the interests of a still greater sensation. Is it your\n",
      "intention to tell me how you mean to proceed in the blasting of my\n",
      "home, or do you still prefer to work in the dark?\"The man was actually arraigning her! Or was this merely a game of\n",
      "bluff? What kind of woman did he take her to be! The indignant blood\n",
      "surged in her veins; she got out of the comfortable chair and took an\n",
      "uncompromising straight-backed one directly opposite his.\"Are you so accustomed to 'working in the dark' that you fancy others\n",
      "are doing it also?\" she said, fixing him with her clear gaze. \"Did you\n",
      "suppose that I had the slightest idea of meeting you when I came to\n",
      "this house and accepted its hospitality?\"His face changed suddenly and he bent forward as if to lessen the\n",
      "distance between them, speaking eagerly.\"Have I been mistaken in you? Mrs. Dunlap, on your honor as a woman,\n",
      "did you not find out my name somewhere and follow me, to this house\n",
      "with my discomfiture in view?\"\"I certainly did not!\" she answered indignantly. \"Do you think I would\n",
      "have slept under your roof knowingly? I have not yet awakened from the\n",
      "daze of horror into which the sight of you threw me.\"\"Then I beg your pardon,\" he said with evident relief. \"I have wronged\n",
      "you. Now I will literally and gratefully, if you will permit the word,\n",
      "throw myself on your mercy. You see what my home is, and my family I\n",
      "have children. You have been given some idea of what they think of me,\n",
      "and what I am in the main; an attentive husband and father, doing his\n",
      "utmost for the comfort of his home. You happen to have seen me under\n",
      "damning conditions, and without understanding the—the temptations. And\n",
      "now you have it in your power to ruin this home and blast the future\n",
      "of young and trusting lives; as well as break a woman's heart! Or,\n",
      "you have it in your power to save us all! You are a merciful woman, a\n",
      "philanthropist, my wife tells me, I believe you will save us. You see I\n",
      "am not asking justice, but pleading for mercy.\"He had not moved her by a hair's breadth unless it were to increase her\n",
      "indignation. Her voice was steady and cold.\"Did you not have it in your power to ruin two homes, one of them\n",
      "widowed and fatherless, and did you spare them? You dare to talk to me\n",
      "of 'mercy' and 'philanthropy' when you were not willing to shelter even\n",
      "your own fireside!\"He dropped his eyes from her face and worked nervously with the paper\n",
      "cutter he held.\"You do not understand,\" he said. \"It will be difficult to make you\n",
      "understand! You are one who makes no allowance for a man's temptations.\"She flashed a look of scorn at him, but he did not look at her, and\n",
      "went on more quickly.\"I don't know what devil possessed me to do as I did that night. I did\n",
      "not plan it, deliberately. I did not plan any of it, it just happened.\n",
      "A fellow, whom we called 'the parson' in college, because he always\n",
      "took those parts in the plays, had just written me about a mock wedding\n",
      "at which he had officiated, and he was within easy reach. The truth is\n",
      "the girl tempted me!\"He caught the flash in her eyes just then, and heard and understood her\n",
      "words:\"Oh, of course; 'The woman beguiled me'!\"He pulled himself together. \"I simply mean that she was—was—very\n",
      "bewildering, and I—\" He was finding it hard to explain. He wished that\n",
      "the woman would look at the floor; or at something, instead of at him!\"I am going to be entirely frank with you,\" he said at last, with a\n",
      "sudden assumption of friendliness. \"My wife is—we are—not congenial,\n",
      "not well mated; our marriage was a sort of mockery, from the first, one\n",
      "of convenience, one may say, on my part. I thought I ought to marry her\n",
      "because she cared for me, and because well, for family reasons. I never\n",
      "really loved with my whole soul any woman until I met Daisy; after I\n",
      "knew her, what seemed really wrong to me, was to continue the travesty\n",
      "of home life when I knew that home, to me, meant her. I intended, I\n",
      "fully intended, as soon as the necessary preliminaries could be managed\n",
      "to set myself free, in order to possess her.\"But I did not plan to injure her reputation in any way, nor indeed\n",
      "anyone's reputation. Divorces are common enough I am sure. The idea\n",
      "of running away with Daisy for a few weeks came upon me, as I said,\n",
      "suddenly. I was going West, very far West, and she was returning home,\n",
      "when I met her on the train. It was impossible for me not to see how\n",
      "easily we could enjoy a delightful season together, at some pleasant\n",
      "resort where neither of us was known—merely as good friends you\n",
      "understand. The marriage ceremony was to be a temporary convenience to\n",
      "quiet her nervousness, to be explained afterwards as a good joke. On my\n",
      "honor I meant nothing else.\"He came to a sudden pause, for Mary Dunlap had risen, her face white\n",
      "with righteous indignation.\"I must interrupt you,\" she said. \"I fail to see why you should\n",
      "disgrace yourself and me by exposing such details, or attempting to\n",
      "gloss over your sin. If you think to win sympathy thereby, you must\n",
      "have a strange idea of women! You to defile that sacred word 'love'\n",
      "in such connection! Why even a wild beast knows that love means\n",
      "protection, means sacrifice of self for the sake of the object loved!\n",
      "But you loved this child only enough to practice upon her the most\n",
      "cruel deception a man can offer to a woman, to blight her future, and\n",
      "bring despair to her family, for the sake of gratifying for a few\n",
      "weeks, your passion for her society!\"It is folly to suppose that you did not know what you were doing! You\n",
      "are neither a fool, nor a lunatic. Why do you want to grovel before me\n",
      "by exposing that whole vile plot? It seems amazing that you can have\n",
      "so soon forgotten what you said to me that night at the hotel; and\n",
      "how awfully your words and your position contradict those statements!\n",
      "Before I saw you in this house this morning, as the husband of another\n",
      "woman, I supposed you were a half-way decent villain, who had tried to\n",
      "run away with and marry the girl he fancied he loved.\"He too had risen. He trembled visibly and he was white to his lips, but\n",
      "he tried to speak with dignity.\"I have made a mistake,\" he said. \"I see I cannot make you understand.\n",
      "But I am ready to grovel still, and beg your mercy. I have not ruined\n",
      "her; she is free from me forever; and I am asking you to have pity on\n",
      "my wife and children. And since no harm can come to anyone by your\n",
      "silence, to spare my family. I am ready to give you my word of honor\n",
      "that I will never see the girl again, never attempt to communicate with\n",
      "her in any way.\"Mrs. Dunlap's immediate response to this, brought a scarlet flush over\n",
      "his face and set the blood humming in his ears: \"Your word of honor!\"But he was in real terror now; he had neither cowed nor deceived\n",
      "this woman. No sentimental twaddle about uncongenial marriages and\n",
      "soul-love, had done other than deepen her disgust.He was also realizing something of the power that such a woman would\n",
      "have, once she exerted it, against him; and she was his wife's friend!\n",
      "Yet he had an instinct that he could trust her. He must beg.\"I deserve that,\" he said, after a breathless moment. \"Well then, I\n",
      "will swear by all that you hold sacred never to see or try to hear from\n",
      "that girl again. Will you keep my secret?\"For a full minute, which must have seemed an hour to the waiting man,\n",
      "there was silence in that room. Then Mary Dunlap spoke.\"With conditions, yes; but you must do more than that. There are\n",
      "other girls in the world. I do not ask you to give me your pledged\n",
      "word because—\" There was a single expressive gesture of her hand that\n",
      "consigned any \"pledged\" word of his to the lowest level of contempt,\n",
      "and she left it to complete the sentence.\"But you have chosen to speak of me as a philanthropist. Perhaps you\n",
      "are aware that my life is given to the protection of young innocent\n",
      "girls who are in danger because of such men as you; and you may\n",
      "possibly understand what mighty forces I can call to my aid anywhere\n",
      "in the civilized world, if occasion requires. In view of this, for the\n",
      "sake of your wife and daughters, so long as you keep your life steadily\n",
      "within the law that governs respectable men, and hold yourself from\n",
      "insulting, by your attentions, not only the girl you tried to ruin, but\n",
      "every other girl and woman on God's earth, I will agree to keep silence\n",
      "to all but the one whose affections you have stolen, and her mother!\n",
      "These two shall know all that I do; the girl, that she may learn to\n",
      "turn from the thought of you with loathing, and the mother that she may\n",
      "guard her child with jealous care from men like you.\"Then, I must remind you that the same forces for righteousness that\n",
      "stand ready to help me, are as able to keep me informed as to how\n",
      "steadily you adhere to the terms I have made. On these grounds do you\n",
      "wish mercy from me?\"The man was looking steadily at her now. Man of the world as he was,\n",
      "hypocrite as the life he lived had trained him to be, accustomed to\n",
      "sneering at women, to flirting with women, to boasting within himself\n",
      "that he could lead them captive at his will, he looked at this woman\n",
      "whose hair was silvering, and felt that she could, and would, keep her\n",
      "word! For a long minute, he gazed at her, as one compelled to consider\n",
      "her, then bowed silently, and dropped his gaze to the floor.There were quick steps in the hall, an eager hand on the door-knob, and\n",
      "Mrs. Oliver fluttered in.\"It was a long half hour, wasn't it?\" she began. \"Those women would\n",
      "talk! I thought I should never get away from them. Goodness! What is\n",
      "the matter with you two? You look as though you were posing for high\n",
      "tragedy. You haven't quarreled, have you?\"Mary Dunlap arose to the occasion.\"My dear Mrs. Oliver, I have decided that I shall have to change my\n",
      "plans, and start for Albany by the noon train to-day. There is a matter\n",
      "I have concluded must have my immediate attention.\"Mrs. Oliver was voluble with regrets. Such a disappointment! She\n",
      "had been planning for this one day for so long! And Mr. Oliver was\n",
      "unexpectedly here to enjoy it with them! So sorry especially to have\n",
      "her miss seeing their new Y. W. building that had been planned \"in\n",
      "exact accordance with your own ideas, dear Mrs. Dunlap, and it is\n",
      "simply perfect. Do, Ralph, tell her how sorry you are not to be able to\n",
      "show her through it.\"Thus urged, Mr. Oliver succeeded in finding voice to say: \"Mrs. Dunlap\n",
      "understands, I am sure, better than I could tell her, how ready I am to\n",
      "do her bidding.\"Mrs. Dunlap got away by the noon train and took the night-express\n",
      "for the West, canceling all her engagements for the week; she had\n",
      "more important work to look after. Not telegrams, nor long distance\n",
      "telephones, nor even carefully written letters could serve her now. She\n",
      "must go in person to try to explain, as best she might, to that dear\n",
      "girl who was waiting at home to hear from one to whom she had given her\n",
      "trust, to prove him to her mother as \"good and noble!\"As she sped westward that afternoon the good woman prayed that she\n",
      "might be able to help save that sweet, periled life.MRS. SHELDON and her daughter Daisy were occupying easy chairs in their\n",
      "pleasant living-room, surrounded by all possible evidences of home\n",
      "comforts, and luxuries. But even a passing glance at the two faces\n",
      "would have suggested unrest. The mother's face looked worn, and her\n",
      "eyes were anxious; while the daughter's eyes were tense with excitement.\"Daisy dear,\" began Mrs. Sheldon, and was interrupted:\"Please, Mother, won't you call me 'Marguerite'?\"A look of pain flushed the mother's face but she spoke quietly.\"Why, daughter, you know I nearly always say 'Daisy.'\"\"I know you do; but I—I don't like it to-night; I—Mother, I just can't\n",
      "bear the sound of it! That's the only explanation I can give.\"Unshed tears were in the mother's eyes. \"I will try to remember,\" she\n",
      "said, her voice low and tremulous. \"But you are my 'Daisy' you know;\n",
      "all I have left in this world; and your father loved that name.\"Daisy with a sudden movement flung herself on the arm of the great easy\n",
      "chair and hid her face in her mother's neck; when she tried to talk her\n",
      "voice choked with sobs.\"Oh, Mother, do please try to understand; you know what Father was to\n",
      "me, and you surely know that I love you with all my soul. If I hadn't,\n",
      "I—\"But the convulsive sobs came again, and she once more hid her face,\n",
      "while the mother's arms clasped her tenderly. A few minutes passed,\n",
      "then the girl sat erect and tried again.\"Mother dear, forgive me.\" As she spoke, she slipped to the footstool\n",
      "beside her mother's chair. \"I didn't mean to worry you. I don't often\n",

      "couldn't bear it! I spoke right out, before I thought.\"Mother, it seems as though you must understand what I mean! Don't you\n",
      "know you told me about how you loved Father so very much even right at\n",
      "the first? That is the way I feel about Rufus. Mother, I love him with\n",
      "all my soul, and I always shall! I never before knew what love meant,\n",
      "that kind of love, I mean and I can't tell you how it almost kills me\n",

      "at self-control, and spoke in a more natural tone.\"I'm afraid that's Nelson! I entirely forgot that he was to come\n",
      "to-night if he got back in time, to tell me how the vote went; as if I\n",
      "cared how they voted!\"With this last word, her voice had returned to bitter sarcasm; but\n",
      "after a moment she continued more quietly.\"Will you see him, Mother, and tell him tell him anything you like?\n",
      "I simply cannot talk with him to-night; nor with anybody else. Oh,\n",
      "Mother, kiss me and let me run away!\"By this time the poor mother had no words to offer about anything.\n",
      "She put her arms around her daughter, kissed her tenderly and opened\n",
      "the door for her to escape by way of the back hall, just as the maid\n",
      "appeared at the sitting-room doorway, card tray in hand.\"For Miss Daisy, ma'am. Has she gone upstairs? Shall I take it up to\n",
      "her room?\"\"No,\" said the weary, faithful mother. \"Daisy does not feel able to see\n",
      "callers to-night; I'll attend to it.\"She held out her hand for the card and read on it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. J. C. Dunlap, Albany.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dunlap!\" Over that name the face of the mother flushed, then paled.That was the name of the woman who had watched over her darling with\n",
      "such wise and patient care, and brought her safely home! Could it\n",
      "possibly be the same woman who was waiting in the parlor! If so, how\n",
      "could she talk with her just now? She felt completely exhausted. Still,\n",
      "Daisy certainly must not be called. She reminded herself that the name\n",
      "Dunlap was common enough, even though she did not happen to recall it\n",
      "among her acquaintances. It really was not at all probable that a woman\n",
      "who lived hundreds of miles away should suddenly appear late in the\n",
      "evening to make a call!At last she crossed the hall and opened the living-room door. One\n",
      "glance sufficed; the woman who arose at her entrance was the same one\n",
      "who had kissed Daisy goodbye with unmistakable tenderness only a few\n",
      "days before!\"I'm afraid I have startled you,\" said Mary Dunlap moving forward; for\n",
      "Daisy's mother had paused suddenly the moment she caught sight of her\n",
      "caller, and her pale face was expressive of pain. \"Of course you did\n",
      "not expect to see me so soon again, but I—it became my duty to return\n",
      "West sooner than I had planned. I hope I may see your daughter for a\n",
      "few minutes? There is a—I have heard of—something connected with our\n",
      "journey together, that she, perhaps, ought to be told.\"It was a very hesitating sentence; the speaker's tone and manner\n",
      "suggested embarrassing uncertainty as to just what she should do next.\n",
      "Something helped the mother to self-control and decision. Whatever that\n",
      "woman thought she ought to tell Daisy ought to be told! She believed in\n",
      "her! She might be mistaken in judgment, of course; unduly alarmed about\n",
      "a small matter; all people were liable to mistakes, occasionally. But\n",
      "she was sincere! Of that, Mrs. Sheldon felt absolutely sure; and what\n",
      "she had to say might help to clear away some anxieties. She held out\n",
      "her hand and spoke cordially.\"I am glad to see you again, Mrs. Dunlap, but I am afraid that my\n",
      "daughter will not be able to do so, this evening; she has had a\n",
      "somewhat trying day and is feeling to-night as though she could not\n",
      "talk with anybody. She seems nervously unstrung with her recent\n",
      "experiences. She has retired, I think, but perhaps you will trust me\n",
      "with a message?\"Mrs. Dunlap reached a quick decision. \"Perhaps I had better tell you\n",
      "all about it,\" she said, speaking as an intimate friend might have\n",
      "done. \"I have taken a room at the Delport House, and shall not leave\n",
      "until sometime to-morrow afternoon I think. If Daisy is feeling better,\n",
      "I could see her in the morning. I hope you will pardon my interest in\n",
      "your daughter and my familiar use of her name. She and I grew quite\n",
      "intimate during that one day you know.\"The mother's quick thought was, \"What would she think if she knew that\n",
      "I had just been told to say 'Marguerite!'\"Mary Dunlap, noting the troubled glance of the mother hurried on:\"I had a precious little girl of my own, once, about your daughter's\n",
      "age, Mrs. Sheldon. She was my only child. That night when your daughter\n",
      "stayed with me in my room was the first time I had ever been able to\n",
      "say with my whole heart, 'Thank God my Margaret is forever safe in the\n",
      "Everlasting arms!'\"That is my apology for intruding on you again. And now, perhaps it\n",
      "would be wiser for me to have my talk with you, leaving you to repeat\n",
      "as much or as little as you see fit, to your daughter.\"Mrs. Sheldon answered quickly, excitedly: \"Oh, I wish you would!\" she\n",
      "said, \"I have so longed to see you and ask you a lot of questions.\n",
      "Won't you sit down? And please, tell me first, about that night at the\n",
      "hotel. I know so very little about it, and I want to understand exactly\n",
      "what happened. Daisy is very vague in her story, and is so excitable\n",
      "that I dare not question her in her present state. All that I now know\n",
      "positively is that because of crowded conditions at the hotel, you\n",
      "kindly permitted her to share your room for the night.\"\"Is it possible that you have not been told the whole story!\" exclaimed\n",
      "Mary Dunlap in amazement. It seemed incredible that such a girl as the\n",
      "one she had protected had kept her mother in ignorance of the whole of\n",
      "that night's happenings.\"Oh, tell me quickly!\" said the mother, with instant premonition,\n",
      "dropping down on the edge of the couch where the caller had seated\n",
      "herself. \"Tell me all, please. I have been utterly at a loss to\n",
      "understand Daisy's unstrung state of mind.\"Mary Dunlap wondered wildly where she should begin and then plunged\n",
      "into her subject.\"First, may I ask, please, about this Mr. Keller whom I met that night\n",
      "with your daughter? Of course I knew nothing of him whatever. Is he a\n",
      "personal acquaintance of yours? A—friend?\"There was an instant flash of indignation in the mother's eyes.\"Certainly not!\" she replied with almost haughtiness in her voice. \"I\n",
      "have met him but once and I have never liked anything that I have heard\n",
      "about him. He is a sort of a traveling agent I believe for some New\n",
      "York firm, and business seems to call him to this particular town more\n",
      "frequently than I could wish. My daughter thinks that I am prejudiced\n",
      "against him because of certain stories we have heard about him, which\n",
      "she thinks have no foundation except in malicious gossip. But frankly,\n",
      "he is a source of much anxiety to me.\"For the past few months he has been quite attentive to Daisy, that\n",
      "is, as attentive as circumstances would allow, and I—do not trust him.\n",
      "I do not know why. But I don't! I am utterly at a loss to account for\n",
      "the influence he seems to have acquired over her in the few brief\n",
      "meetings they have had. She thinks me hard and cruel because I well, I\n",
      "can scarcely bear the sound of his name! And yet I have to confess that\n",
      "I have no good reason to offer for such a feeling. It appears that he\n",
      "really asked her to marry him. The idea is so obnoxious to me that I\n",
      "can scarcely bear to utter the words!\"\"And this trip they were taking together,\" ventured the troubled\n",
      "questioner; \"you knew about it of course?\"\"Trip!\" exclaimed the mother indignantly. \"They were not traveling\n",
      "together! Why, I sent her away on this visit to get her out of his\n",
      "vicinity because I heard that he was intending to remain in this\n",
      "town several weeks! They simply met on the train. Daisy thinks it\n",
      "was a coincidence I suppose from what she says, but of course, he\n",
      "followed her. I am positive of that. To put it plainly, he seems to\n",
      "be infatuated with her. And she, poor child, has admitted to me this\n",
      "very afternoon that she loves him with all her heart! Oh, it seems so\n",
      "terrible for me to be telling this to you, a stranger, burdening you\n",
      "with my anxiety.\"Mrs. Sheldon wiped the tears away from her eyes, and struggled to keep\n",
      "more from falling. \"But you have been so kind to me and to Daisy, and\n",
      "there has been no one to whom I could go for advice.\"Mary Dunlap slipped an arm around the shoulders of the mother with\n",
      "strong reassurance.\"My dear!\" she said in her warm comforting strong voice, \"Just you cry\n",
      "if you want to, and don't worry about telling me. I'm used to helping\n",
      "mothers and girls. It is my job in life. And don't you worry. I'm going\n",
      "to help you, and I thank God I can. I'm glad too that you have told me\n",
      "this, for now I can speak frankly and tell you all I know. It is going\n",
      "to make things a lot easier to set right. And now, I've got to tell you\n",
      "the whole story.\"THE voice was low and tender in which she began her story of the\n",
      "afternoon on the train. She made it plain that she had been so busy\n",
      "with her writing that she scarcely noticed who got on the train until\n",
      "toward evening when her work was done. She had been barely conscious of\n",
      "the two who took the seat in front of her, had given them but a swift\n",
      "glance and decided that they were bride and groom; until her work was\n",
      "done and she had leisure to look around. And then almost at once she\n",
      "was fascinated by the lovely face of the girl in front of her.Mary Dunlap was quick to note the pleased relaxing of the troubled face\n",
      "as she said this, and the instant sympathy as she gave her own first\n",
      "impression of the man who was sitting beside the girl.But as the tale progressed showing how late the train was, with\n",
      "inevitable missed connections, the mother's eye kindled with gratitude.\"Oh!\" she interrupted, \"I'm so glad you were there! What would Daisy\n",
      "have done if you had not been. She is so unused to traveling alone!\"Mary Dunlap went on to tell of the apparent argument between the two\n",
      "in front of her, the discomfort on the face of the girl, and her own\n",
      "continued wonder that such a girl should apparently be married to a\n",
      "man so much older, and of such a type. The mother gave a little gasp\n",
      "of dismay as she realized that this fine Christian woman had actually\n",
      "thought her daughter was married to that man! But it was only the\n",
      "dismay she had felt before at the horrible thought of him, and the old\n",
      "resentment at the idea of his presuming to be intimate with her girl.Not until the story progressed to the point where Mrs. Dunlap stood\n",
      "before the hotel desk writing her own name in the registry and noted\n",
      "the names on the line just above her own, \"R. H. Keller and wife,\" did\n",
      "the mother grasp the full meaning of it all. Then she leaned forward\n",
      "with a quick little motion and caught at both the firm capable hands of\n",
      "her visitor, crying:\"Oh, Mrs. Dunlap! You don't mean it! You can't mean that he dared do a\n",
      "thing like that! The wretch! The—the—beast!\"Her eyes were full of tears again. She could not seem to be able to get\n",
      "words strong enough to express her horror and disgust.\"But of course my Daisy didn't know that!\" she said lifting up her head\n",
      "with a gleam of hope, though there was a sob in the end of her voice.\"Not until I told her, some time afterwards,\" said Mary Dunlap.\"You told her! She knows! And yet she could tell me to-day that she\n",
      "loves him! Oh! What shall I do?\"\"Wait, dear Mrs. Sheldon,\" said Mrs. Dunlap putting a detaining hand on\n",
      "the drooping shoulder. \"Love is a strange thing. It throws illusions\n",
      "over the object that turn it into something entirely different. You\n",
      "must remember that. Don't blame Daisy too much. She explained to me at\n",
      "once after her first startled look, that of course he had done that to\n",
      "protect her reputation, since they had been delayed and all their plans\n",
      "upset. She said that they had expected to reach San Fergus at midnight,\n",
      "and that a minister friend of Mr. Keller's was to have met the train\n",
      "and performed the marriage ceremony. She said that Mr. Keller had\n",
      "telegraphed ahead for the bridal suite to be reserved for them in the\n",
      "San Fergus hotel.\"\"My Daisy told you that!\"It was years before Mrs. Dunlap forgot the tone, and the look on that\n",
      "mother's face when she said those words. It was as if some one had\n",
      "suddenly taken from her everything that was worth while in life, as if\n",
      "she felt that all the years of tender rearing, and care of precious\n",
      "love and companionship between her and her child were suddenly wiped\n",
      "out in one great awful act of disloyalty and broken faith with her\n",
      "mother. Oh, there would be a reaction by and by when the mother would\n",
      "excuse, and forgive, and bleed over her darling; but this first blow\n",
      "was like the very severing of the life bond between them, and it was\n",
      "terrible to witness.Mary Dunlap felt that it was a pity that the girl had not had to suffer\n",
      "that look herself with full understanding of all that it meant to her\n",
      "wonderful little mother.\"My dear! I feel like a surgeon performing an operation, but you must\n",
      "know it all,\" said Mary Dunlap tenderly.\"Oh, yes, yes,\" breathed the mother sorrowfully. \"If there is more, go\n",
      "on. It seems as if nothing mattered if Daisy, my Daisy, would go to\n",
      "such lengths. Actually running away to get married!\"\"My dear friend, you must remember that she thinks she is very much in\n",
      "love, and that she feels that you have been deceived about her loved\n",
      "one. They were planning to send you a telegram immediately as soon\n",
      "as the ceremony was performed, and were counting confidently on your\n",
      "immediate change of feeling so soon as the inevitable step was taken.\n",
      "You must remember also that your daughter was greatly troubled even\n",
      "then, at the momentary deception.\"As the time drew near, and the delay became inevitable, she began\n",
      "to see the whole thing in more nearly its true light, and it caused\n",
      "her deep distress. So much so that when Mr. Keller left her for a few\n",
      "moments in the hotel parlor where we both were waiting for our rooms\n",
      "to be prepared, she utterly forgot my presence, and began walking up\n",
      "and down the room, and actually giving a little moan of distress. It\n",
      "was then that I dared to interfere and offer my sympathy and any help I\n",
      "could give.\"\"Oh, how can I ever thank you! How can I thank God enough for having\n",
      "sent you there!\" moaned the stricken mother.\"I think He did plan that I should be there,\" said Mary Dunlap\n",
      "reverently. \"I was scheduled to be far from there at that time, had\n",
      "important speaking engagements to fill, and could not understand why\n",
      "all my plans were frustrated, but it seems that the Father had need\n",
      "of a servant right there, and perhaps this was more important than\n",
      "any meeting I could have addressed. I began to feel so as soon as\n",
      "your Daisy turned to me so readily, so even eagerly, like the little\n",
      "flower-faced child that she is.\"I had no difficulty in getting her to tell me her trouble. She trusted\n",
      "me at once, and when I offered my room as a refuge for the night she\n",
      "accepted most eagerly. Even when I told her how she was booked in the\n",
      "registry, she did not turn from me, as I feared she might. Instead she\n",
      "seemed aghast for a moment; then her loyalty to her lover made her at\n",
      "once attempt to excuse him. However, that did not prevent her from\n",
      "begging me to take her to the room immediately, before he returned from\n",
      "his telegraphing. She seemed to actually fear his influence upon her\n",
      "and to know that her only safe course was to go while he was gone.\"\"Oh, my poor child!\" moaned the mother.\"She made it very plain that Mr. Keller had overpersuaded her to\n",
      "this marriage, and that while she could not bear to refuse him, she\n",
      "yet longed to wait until your consent could be obtained. Of course I\n",
      "advised her strongly that this was the only possible right course, and\n",
      "she seemed to agree with me.\"\"Yes, Daisy is very conscientious that is she was, before this came.\n",
      "But she seems to be infatuated with that man! She has at this moment\n",
      "more faith in him than in anyone else, I believe.\"\"Well, she was glad to get to my room then, at least,\" said the other\n",
      "woman. \"She even wanted the door locked, and when I started to go down\n",
      "and tell Mr. Keller that she was safe and comfortable for the night\n",
      "with a woman, she begged me to lock the door and take the key with me!\"\"And yet she can say she loves him, when she cannot trust him! And at\n",
      "such a time! Oh, my little girl!\"\"Dear friend, the human heart is a curious thing, and the devil has\n",
      "many illusions wherewith to deceive, you know.\"\"And did you actually go down and talk to that man? What a wonderful\n",
      "heaven-sent friend you proved to be!\"\"I did. I'm afraid I rather enjoyed the commission. You must remember I\n",
      "had been watching him in the train for several hours, and while he was\n",
      "most courteous and assiduous in caring for her, and did nothing that I\n",
      "could really put my finger on with which to find fault, I had acquired\n",
      "the same feeling toward him that you seem to have. I just could not see\n",
      "how that little flower of a girl could have married him. And of course\n",
      "when I talked with your daughter, finding out they were not married\n",
      "after having seen how he registered, my feelings were anything but\n",
      "lenient toward him.\"\"I should think so! But oh, my little girl! What would her father have\n",
      "said if he could have known she was to pass through a thing like this!\"\"Courage, dear sister. I am sure God means something lovely to come out\n",
      "of all this.\"\"How could that possibly be!\" moaned the mother, \"Oh, if she could have\n",
      "been spared any contact with a creature like that! It is so terrible to\n",
      "see her pass through such an experience. My little Daisy!\"\"Yes, but Mrs. Sheldon, think, if she did not have you in this trying\n",
      "time!\"Suddenly there occurred an interruption. The two women became aware\n",
      "that the maid had answered a ring at the door, and had let in someone\n",
      "who was standing in the doorway of the room where they were sitting.Mrs. Sheldon got up quickly, with a hasty dab at her wet eyelashes and\n",
      "went toward him.Mary Dunlap looked up to see a tall young man standing in the doorway\n",
      "with his hat in his hand, a grave questioning look upon his face. He\n",
      "had keen gray eyes, a crop of nicely groomed reddish curls, and he\n",
      "looked strong and young and dependable.\"Oh, Nelson!\" exclaimed Mrs. Sheldon, a kind of dazed relief in her\n",
      "voice, \"You came to see Daisy about that committee meeting, didn't you?\n",
      "Why—she—she wasn't feeling very well to-night, Nelson. She has retired.\n",
      "She had a headache. She asked me to excuse her.\"The grave eyes took on a look of anxiety.\"Daisy not well?\" he said as if that were an unheard of thing.\"I should have telephoned you not to come,\" apologized Mrs. Sheldon,\n",
      "\"but this friend of hers—this friend of mine—arrived just then, from\n",
      "out of town, and it slipped my mind. Let me introduce you to Mrs.\n",
      "Dunlap, Nelson. Mrs. Dunlap, Mr. Whitney.\"\"A friend of Daisy's?\" said the young man his grave eyes lighting\n",
      "pleasantly, and he stepped forward and grasped Mrs. Dunlap's hand,\n",
      "giving her a swift searching glance.\"I certainly am!\" said Mary Dunlap with a hearty handclasp.He lingered only a minute or two to leave a message for the daughter\n",
      "about what had happened at the committee meeting, but he gave another\n",
      "keen parting glance accompanied by a warming smile as he left, that\n",
      "made the stranger feel that he approved of her, and that he understood\n",
      "that she was in no wise the cause of the tears that he had seen on\n",
      "Daisy's mother's face.After he was gone, Mrs. Sheldon came back to her caller.\"Why couldn't it have been that young man?\" asked Mary Dunlap with a\n",
      "sigh!\"Oh, if it only could have been!\" sighed the mother. \"He is the dearest\n",
      "boy! My husband trusted him so. He has been Daisy's schoolmate and\n",
      "companion for years, and yet she could think she has fallen in love\n",
      "with that other creature!\"\"There, there, dear friend. I tell you the human heart is a mystery.\n",
      "And a girl at Daisy's age gets queer ideas sometimes. She will come out\n",
      "of it and be fine and beautiful. You see!\"\"Oh! I don't know!\" sighed the mother. \"She is so strange! Not even\n",
      "willing to see Nelson. She thought it was Nelson when you came, and\n",
      "rushed away telling me she would not see him nor anyone else to-night!\n",
      "I could not tell him that of course. He has been so kind and so\n",
      "devoted. And I can see that he is terribly worried about this Keller.\n",
      "He looks as if he would like to fight every time Daisy mentions his\n",
      "name. But tell me, what did the fellow do when you told him Daisy was\n",
      "going to remain with you for the night?\"\"Do? He was fairly insolent. He was furious. He told me to mind my\n",
      "own business. He strode around that parlor like a madman, till I told\n",
      "him Daisy had appealed to me for protection, and had told me she was\n",
      "not yet married to him; but that I had seen how he registered in the\n",
      "hotel. Then he calmed down a little and began to try to smooth things\n",
      "over. He tried to explain that he had done that merely to protect the\n",
      "girl, and that he intended to make everything right for her. He even\n",
      "came to the point, before we were done, of saying that perhaps he had\n",
      "been wrong in doing it, but he had followed an impulse when he wrote.\n",
      "Oh, you know how a man like that could lie himself out of anything! He\n",
      "even said that of course if Daisy preferred to be with me, it was all\n",
      "right, but he really must see her before she slept and arrange about\n",
      "his telegrams. Of course I saw through that. He knew his influence over\n",
      "her!\"So I told him she had asked not to be disturbed, and that she did not\n",
      "wish to see him again until she was at home with her mother and her\n",
      "mother knew all. Then he began to rave at me of course but I let him\n",
      "understand that I should not hesitate to call for assistance if he\n",
      "made further trouble, and I fancy he did not care for publicity, so he\n",
      "withdrew with what grace he could.\"\"And then?\"\"Well, strange to say we had no further trouble with him. I had looked\n",
      "up trains and found there was a very early one. Perhaps he was asleep,\n",
      "although I was taking no chances. I decided to stay by till I placed\n",
      "her safely in her mother's care.\"\"You have been wonderful!\" said the mother. \"I can never thank you.\n",
      "And I'm glad too, that you came and told me all to-night. It has been\n",
      "very hard to hear, but it was right that I should know. Only, my dear\n",
      "new strong friend, I don't know what I am going to do. I am terrified\n",
      "at what may yet develop. I am sure that man will not be easily shaken\n",
      "off. He is probably only waiting till Daisy gets all strained up with\n",
      "anxiety, as she is now, when he knows she will be wax in his hands. I\n",
      "cannot believe he will give up so easily. He will know that you cannot\n",
      "linger around to protect always, and unfortunately, he is not afraid of\n",
      "me.\"\"My dear, wait until you have heard the rest of the story.\"\"Oh, is there more?\" The mother's face showed a new terror.She sat up tense and anxious clasping her frail hands in one another\n",
      "till the knuckles showed white.\"No, dear Mrs. Sheldon, don't be frightened,\" went on Mary Dunlap. \"I\n",
      "will try to be as brief as possible, but I am sure you should know\n",
      "everything.\"\"Oh, yes!\" implored the white lipped mother.Mary Dunlap's heart ached for her as she went on with the story:\"After I left Daisy with you that morning I went directly to New York\n",
      "where I was to be entertained by a Mrs. Oliver whom I had met a number\n",
      "of times in connection with my public work. She had often invited me to\n",
      "be her guest and talk over various matters with her, but I had never\n",
      "been able to arrange a definite date before. I arrived at midnight, and\n",
      "was taken almost at once to my room, seeing none of the family that\n",
      "night except my hostess.\"But the next morning at breakfast I was introduced to her two lovely\n",
      "daughters, and a moment later to her husband who had arrived a few\n",
      "moments before on an early train from the West. Perhaps you can imagine\n",
      "my horror when I looked up to greet him, and found that the man to whom\n",
      "Mrs. Oliver was introducing me, calling him 'her husband Mr. Oliver,'\n",
      "was the Mr. Keller from whom your daughter had been rescued a few\n",
      "nights before!\"Mary Dunlap had told the end of her story rapidly, conscious that her\n",
      "listener was under a heavy strain, and now she looked up with relief\n",
      "that all was told.But the poor mother had borne all she could. She suddenly drooped and\n",
      "would have fallen if the caller had not put strong arms about her and\n",
      "laid her gently on the couch.\"My dear!\" she said as she stooped over the poor sufferer and patted\n",
      "her gently. \"My dear! Don't feel so terribly about it. I am sure this\n",
      "part of the story should be a relief, for it certainly puts that man in\n",
      "a position where he dare not touch your daughter again!\"\"But oh, to have my Daisy, my baby, mixed up with a man like that!\"\n",
      "wailed the utterly crushed little mother, \"It seems as though I never\n",
      "can lift my head again!\"\"Oh, my dear! That is a very small part of the whole matter. The main\n",
      "thing is that no harm shall come to the child. No one here knows, of\n",
      "course, and he has promised!\"But a new voice broke in the room, clear and ringing and cold like a\n",
      "young Nemesis. \"What are you doing to my mother? Have you come here to\n",
      "make more trouble for us? Who are you, anyway?\"THE girl stood in the doorway, her eyes flashing like blue flames, her\n",
      "delicate profile outlined against the rich portier, chin lifted, in\n",
      "scorn, the light catching the glint of the waves in her pretty hair and\n",
      "turning them into gold, the delicate blue of her silk kimono bringing\n",
      "out the pearly tint of her skin, a haughty little patrician, insolent\n",
      "in her loveliness.Mary Dunlap looked at her in pity, and admiration, and a rising wonder.\n",
      "Was this the girl who had melted to tears in her arms but a few nights\n",
      "before, and implored her to protect her? How lovely she was even in\n",
      "her frenzy. She made a picture as she stood there in her rightful\n",
      "background. Poor, misguided infant! What a hard road she had set her\n",
      "feet to travel, and how soon she must come to humiliation.But the mother was shocked into severity. \"Marguerite!\" she said,\n",
      "sitting bolt upright and looking at her daughter sternly, as she had\n",
      "not looked at nor spoken to her since she was a very little girl,\n",
      "\"Marguerite! You forget yourself! You are beside yourself. Apologize\n",
      "at once to Mrs. Dunlap. You do not know what you are doing! Mrs.\n",
      "Dunlap is the best friend you have in this world. She has gone to\n",
      "great inconvenience and expense and trouble to save you from an awful\n",
      "calamity!\"The Marguerite of a few days ago would have been crushed to earth by\n",
      "such words from her beloved mother. Not so the girl of that night. She\n",
      "did not even wince. Instead she drew herself up to her full height\n",
      "and looked her mother steadily in the eyes, as if their ages had been\n",
      "reversed, and spoke with a certain air of authority that was almost\n",
      "startling.\"No, I am not beside myself, Mother! It is you who do not know what\n",
      "you are doing. You have allowed yourself to be blinded by an utter\n",
      "stranger. You have swallowed whole the lies she has handed out to\n",
      "you. Mother, I understand it all now. This woman is a rank imposter,\n",
      "employed by others to ruin the reputation of a prominent and successful\n",
      "business man, in order to extort money from him. Oh, I have heard a\n",
      "lot that she has been saying! Don't try to stop me. Isn't this kind of\n",
      "thing being done every day now? The daily papers are full of it. Why,\n",
      "even novels are just full of plots like that.\"Didn't that horrid woman whose latest book is being lauded in every\n",
      "column of reviews make one of her characters boast of being a daughter\n",
      "of Eve to some purpose because she had told some successful lies about\n",
      "one of her victims? I tell you, Mother, you don't know the world. Times\n",
      "have changed since you were a girl. You think every woman is good,\n",
      "simply because she is a woman and dresses respectably. That is why you\n",
      "are willing to believe all these terrible things about Rufus, and why\n",
      "you want me to believe them. Just because a woman has told you. Just\n",
      "ask her how much she is to be paid to bring about his ruin. Ask her\n",
      "that! Do you suppose she is to be paid whether she succeeds or not?\n",
      "It must be she isn't; that is why she is so persistent, sneaking in\n",
      "to tell tales to you when I'm not by, and get you on her side. She\n",
      "evidently is afraid she is going to lose her money!\"\"Marguerite! Oh, my poor child!\" exclaimed the mother in horror,\n",
      "beginning to cry. \"Oh, Mrs. Dunlap, I beg you will forgive her. She\n",
      "doesn't know what she is saying.\"\"That is perfectly all right, Mrs. Sheldon, don't think of it for a\n",
      "moment. I understand.\"But the girl's voice broke in scornfully:\"I certainly do know what I am saying. I understand it all perfectly. I\n",
      "can see the plot clearly now. I remember how this woman sat behind us\n",
      "in the cars, doubtless of purpose, listening to us. She was writing all\n",
      "the afternoon. I suppose she took down our private conversation. She\n",
      "probably carries on such business constantly, and chooses her victims\n",
      "among those who look as if they would care about their reputations and\n",
      "have plenty of money to hush up such tales. That is called blackmail,\n",
      "Mother, and I've read quite a lot about it in the papers. But they\n",
      "are not going to frighten us. Rufus and I will search this thing out\n",
      "to the foundations and make it impossible for this woman ever to get\n",
      "in her deadly work on any other good Christian man. It would be even\n",
      "worth sacrificing ourselves if we could do that. It is because people\n",
      "are afraid that they succumb to such things as this. We are not afraid!\n",
      "This woman listened to our plans and discussions, and knew just where\n",
      "to get us, that is all. If I hadn't been such a fool, I would have\n",
      "understood at the time, and I shouldn't have yielded to the spell she\n",
      "cast over me. She must be a hypnotist. She somehow succeeded in making\n",
      "everything look different from what it really is. But she can't do it\n",
      "again. I've got my eyes open!\"These are a few of the indignant sarcasms that the two long-suffering\n",
      "women had to listen to as the evening passed on. Mrs. Sheldon,\n",
      "mortified to the extreme of agony over the way her daughter was raving\n",
      "out against the wonderful woman who had saved her from a life of\n",
      "humiliation; alarmed beyond measure for the sanity of the one who was\n",
      "dearer to her than life, roused from her own weakness and tried every\n",
      "possible means to bring the girl to reason, all to no purpose.At last Mary Dunlap who had stood by helpless, trying to think of\n",
      "something she might say which would bring the girl to her senses,\n",
      "leaned over toward the mother and said in a low tone:\"Suppose I just go away for the night now. She is excited and the sight\n",
      "of me only irritates her. If she could get some sleep she might be more\n",
      "reasonable in the morning. No, don't get up. I can find my own way to\n",
      "the door. You can telephone if you need me. I shall stay close to my\n",
      "room till I hear from you. And I will pray! Don't despair, dear sister!\n",
      "God is strong! Now—I will just slip away!\"The keen ears of the excited girl caught the last sentence.\"Yes, slip away by all means! I should have thought it might have\n",
      "occurred to you to do so before!\" she flung after the stranger.And then, as the door closed after Mary Dunlap, Marguerite Sheldon\n",
      "began to pace the floor, the very personification of indignant fury.After she had exhausted herself with wild words, she suddenly flung\n",
      "herself down before her mother with her head in her mother's lap and\n",
      "began to sob:\"Oh, Mother, Mother, that dreadful woman has made me almost crazy!\" she\n",
      "sobbed. \"Some of the time I don't seem to know what I am saying. But\n",
      "I know this, and I mean it. I know that Rufus is true to me, and not\n",
      "only to me, but to God. He is very religious, Mother, he really is! You\n",
      "ought to hear him talk. And Mother, I know I love him, love him, with\n",
      "my whole soul! And I shall, forever and ever! No matter how many fiends\n",
      "from the underworld combine to try and make me false to him!\"At the word \"love\" her sobbing suddenly ceased and she sprang to her\n",
      "feet and began pacing up and down the room again; her voice rising to\n",
      "almost a shriek.Of what use to attempt any further words with one who was surely not\n",
      "responsible for what she said or did? The mother slipped to her knees\n",
      "and began to pray.A voice of power spoke to her soul, while she was still on her knees,\n",
      "seeking help. It almost seemed to her that she had heard the spoken\n",
      "words:\"'I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; I will lead them\n",
      "in paths that they have not known. I will make darkness light before\n",
      "them; and crooked things straight.'\"Oh, the wonderful words! Could there be a human being any blinder than\n",
      "her Daisy? And, how terribly she needed new \"paths!\"It was because of this amazing voice that she was able to get through\n",
      "that night, and the early part of the next day and finally to persuade\n",
      "her daughter to receive Mrs. Dunlap in the evening, and hear from her\n",
      "lips what she had to tell.This was in accordance with that lady's earnest request made over the\n",
      "telephone, she having decided that the mother was physically unable\n",
      "to endure further strain. But that Christian worker had certainly\n",
      "occasion to look back upon the hour spent with Daisy Sheldon as one of\n",
      "the hardest in her by no means easy life. Not that Daisy did not try,\n",
      "at least at first, to treat her in accordance with all the rules of\n",
      "propriety.But as the story progressed, there was all the time in the narrator's\n",
      "mind the question, \"How shall I convince this girl that I am speaking\n",
      "only truth!\" She who was used to being trusted implicitly, and quoted\n",
      "as unquestioned authority on all points connected with the work to\n",
      "which she had given her life!Yet this girl listened in outward calm to the story that had caused her\n",
      "mother's lapse into almost unconsciousness, with a half smile on her\n",
      "lips, that deepened into a sneer when she finally spoke:\"That is a very strange story, Mrs. Dunlap! Being as well acquainted\n",
      "with Mr. Keller as I am, I don't quite understand how I could be\n",
      "expected to credit it! I should really like to see a photograph of\n",
      "this mysterious person, to help me in conceiving how a woman of your\n",
      "discernment could have been so deceived! Although I should remember\n",
      "that your acquaintance with Mr. Keller covered a very brief space of\n",
      "time; while he is, of course, my closest friend.\"Could this be the girl who had so very recently clung to her, weeping,\n",
      "and begging to be shielded from even the sight of the man who was her\n",
      "\"closest friend!\" How could Mrs. Dunlap help giving a second's thought\n",
      "to such a question? But she turned swiftly from it and tried again.\"Wait, please,\" she said patiently, \"I must tell you the rest. I have\n",
      "had a longer acquaintance with the man than you have heard as yet.\n",
      "After breakfast Mrs. Oliver asked him to take me into the library and\n",
      "show me some prints while she attended to other duties, and when he had\n",
      "closed and locked the doors, he threw himself on my mercy and begged me\n",
      "not to wreck his household by telling his wife and children what I knew\n",
      "about him. He did not attempt to deny that he was of course the same\n",
      "Mr. Keller with whom I had held a long conversation two nights before.\"In fact, he frankly owned that you had been what he called a\n",
      "'temptation' to him, but that the marriage ceremony which he professed\n",
      "at that time to be about to enter into, had been only a joke, of\n",
      "course, intended to relieve your anxieties for being away from your\n",
      "mother longer than you had planned. I would not like to tear your heart\n",
      "nor soil my lips by repeating the words that he used to describe your\n",
      "wonderful mother and her ignorant prejudice as he called it.\"He also told me that his friend who posed as a minister for the time\n",
      "being was an amateur play actor who had successfully impersonated a\n",
      "clergyman while they were in college, which gave him the idea of a mock\n",
      "marriage to quiet your protests.\"And now, I will show you a paper written and signed by this man, in\n",
      "which he pledges never to write or telegraph or telephone you, or\n",
      "visit you again. It is a paper that I went back to secure, after I had\n",
      "started on this western trip, and the man knows that his keeping this\n",
      "agreement both in letter and spirit is the price of my silence toward\n",
      "his wife and children. His wife is a charming and beautiful woman, and\n",
      "his two daughters are as sweet and charming as yourself. It seemed\n",
      "terrible to wreck that home, but I would not keep silence unless I felt\n",
      "sure you would be safe forever from him.\"Marguerite Sheldon tilted her patrician chin haughtily, a little smile\n",
      "of scorn on her lovely lips.\"Mrs. Dunlap,\" she said, \"you certainly are mistress of y.'our language. You must\n",

      "FOREWORD\n",
      "AS LONG ago as I can remember there was always a radiant being who was\n",
      "next to my mother and father in my heart, and who seemed to me to be a\n",
      "sort of a combination of fairy godmother, heroine, and saint. I thought\n",
      "her the most beautiful, wise, and wonderful person in my world, outside\n",
      "of my home. I treasured her smiles, copied her ways, and listened\n",
      "breathlessly to all she had to say, sitting at her feet worshipfully\n",
      "whenever she was near; ready to run any errand for her, no matter how\n",
      "far.I measured other people by her principles and opinions, and always\n",
      "felt that her word was final. I am afraid I even corrected my beloved\n",
      "parents sometimes when they failed to state some principle or opinion\n",
      "as she had done.When she came on a visit the house seemed glorified because of her\n",
      "presence; while she remained, life was one long holiday; when she went\n",
      "away it seemed as if a blight had fallen.Her eyes were dark and had interesting twinkles in them that children\n",
      "loved; her hair was long and dark and very heavy, dressed in two wide\n",
      "braids that were wound round and round her lovely head in smooth coils,\n",
      "fitting close like a cap, but when it was unbraided and brushed out,\n",
      "it fell far below her knees and was like a garment folding her about.\n",
      "How I adored that hair and longed to have hair just like it! How I even\n",
      "used in secret to tie an old brown veil about my head and let it fall\n",
      "down my back, and try to see how it would feel to have hair like that.She had delicate features and a wonderful smile. Nobody else in the\n",
      "world looked just as lovely as did she. But once I found a picture of\n",
      "Longfellow's Evangeline in a photograph album, in exquisite classic\n",
      "profile, and thought it was her likeness. She was like that—if you have\n",
      "that old faded photograph somewhere in an old album with quaint clasps.\n",
      "She was wonderful!And she was young, gracious, and very good to be with.This radiant creature was known to me by the name of \"Auntie Belle,\"\n",
      "though my mother and my grandmother, called her \"Isabella!\" Just like\n",
      "that! Even sharply sometimes when they disagreed with her—\"Isabella!\" I\n",
      "wondered that they dared. I sometimes resented it.Later I found that other people had still other names for her. To the\n",
      "congregation of which her husband was pastor she was known as \"Mrs.\n",
      "Alden.\" It seemed to me too grownup a name for her and made her appear\n",
      "more stately and sedate than she really was. I remember resenting it\n",
      "that these strange people should seem to have rights in her. She was\n",
      "mine. What were they?But when a little later my world grew larger, and knowledge increased,\n",
      "I found that this precious aunt of mine did not belong entirely to us\n",
      "as I had supposed. She had another world in which she moved and had\n",
      "her being when she went from us from time to time; or when at certain\n",
      "hours in the day she shut herself within a room that was sacredly known\n",
      "as a \"study,\" and wrote for a long time, while we all tried to keep\n",
      "still; and in this other world of hers she was known as \"Pansy.\" It was\n",
      "a world that loved and honored her, a world that gave her homage and\n",
      "flowers, and wrote her letters by the hundreds each week.It was not long, too, before I had learned to preen myself like a young\n",
      "peacock because I \"belonged\" to her, and I am afraid I felt a superior\n",
      "pity and contempt for the thousands of other children who read her\n",
      "paper called \"The Pansy\" which she edited, but who did not \"belong\"\n",
      "to her. They could only write letters to her, while I could often be\n",
      "with her every day, sometimes for weeks, and could talk with her all I\n",
      "pleased.As I grew still older and learned to read I devoured her stories\n",
      "chapter by chapter. Even sometimes page by page as they came hot from\n",
      "the typewriter; occasionally stealing in for an instant when she left\n",
      "the study, to snatch the latest page and see what happened next; or to\n",
      "accost her as her morning's work was done, with: \"Oh, have you finished\n",
      "another chapter?\"And often the whole family would crowd around, leaving their work when\n",
      "the word went around that the last chapter was finished and it was\n",
      "going to be read aloud. And now we listened, breathless, as she read,\n",
      "and made her characters live before us. They were real people to us, as\n",
      "real as if they lived and breathed before us.She was at the height of her popularity just then, and the letters that\n",
      "poured in at every mail were overwhelming. Asking for her autograph\n",
      "and her photograph, begging for pieces of her best dress to sew into\n",
      "patchwork; begging for advice how to become a great author; begging for\n",
      "advice on every possible subject, from how to get the right kind of a\n",
      "husband, to how to stop biting one's nails.And she answered them all!It was a Herculean task. Sometimes she let us help her when she was\n",
      "very much rushed, but usually she kept her touch on every letter that\n",
      "went out—and they were thousands.Then there was the editorship of \"The Pansy,\" a young people's paper\n",
      "which was responsible for more thousands of letters from the children\n",
      "who had joined the Pansy Society, and who wrote to her about their\n",
      "faults and how to give them up, \"For Jesus' Sake,\" which was their\n",
      "motto.Sometimes I look back on her long and busy life and marvel what she has\n",
      "accomplished.She was a marvelous housekeeper, knowing every dainty detail of her\n",
      "home to perfection; able to cook anything in the world just a little\n",

      "attends to the social end of life, never bothering about the church.\n",

      "intimate with each one personally and led them to Christ; became their\n",
      "confidante; and loved them all as if they had been her brothers and\n",
      "sisters. She taught the Primary class—and incidentally the mothers of\n",
      "the Primary class. She quietly and unobtrusively managed the Missionary\n",
      "Society and the Ladies' Aid, not always as its executive officer,\n",
      "often keeping quite in the background. She became the dear friend of\n",
      "every woman in the church without making any of them jealous. She was\n",
      "beloved, almost adored of them all.She was a tender, vigilant, wonderful mother, such a mother as few are\n",

      "a delight in drawing, she sometimes took me along to do her blackboard\n",
      "work for her, at which privilege I swelled with pride. She was much in\n",

      "as one of the great ones of the earth, who was paid large sums to tell\n",
      "other people the best ways of teaching, and to read her fascinating\n",
      "stories. How I loved her and hung upon her every word and smile. How\n",
      "proud I was to belong to her! And am still.All these things she did, and yet wrote books! Stories out of real\n",

      "sent us to our knees to talk with Him.With marvelous skill she searched hearts, especially of the easy-going\n",
      "Christian, whether minister or layman, young and old, and brought them\n",
      "awake and alive to their inconsistencies. She wove her stories around\n",
      "their common, everyday life, till all her characters became alive and\n",

      "home, its counterpart; of the years the two families spent much time\n",
      "together as one family. The days were one long dream. Hard work? Yes,\n",
      "but good fellowship. Everybody working together with a common aim, and\n",
      "joy in the work and the fellowship!And the evenings! Oh, those evenings, the crown of the days, the time\n",

      "great tropical moon came out. Those long evenings when the soft dense\n",
      "darkness shut us in to a cheerful supper table, and, after we had\n",
      "hustled through the dishes, we all gathered in the big sitting-room\n",
      "around the open fire for family worship. Yes, we were as old-fashioned\n",
      "as that! We had family worship both morning and evening. And I am not\n",
      "of those modern ones who tell such things to scoff at them and say how\n",
      "sick they got of religion because of it, and lay to that their present\n",
      "indifference to God and the Bible. I look back to those times as the\n",
      "most precious, the most beautiful, the most powerful influence that\n",
      "came into my life. I thank God for a family that worshipped Him morning\n",
      "and evening and gave me an early knowledge and love for the Bible and\n",
      "the things of the Kingdom. Either my uncle or my father would conduct\n",
      "the little service, and often the one or the other of them would say to\n",
      "my dear aunt: \"You read the chapter to-night, Belle,\" just because she\n",
      "was such a beautiful reader and we all loved to listen to her. At other\n",
      "times, we would recite verses, all around, a verse apiece, and then\n",
      "kneel in a circle for the prayer.Oh, those prayers of the years that made my life inevitably acquainted\n",
      "with God, and the Lord Jesus, so that I never could be troubled by the\n",
      "doubts of to-day, because I know Him, \"whom to know is life eternal.\"\n",
      "I cannot be thankful enough for those prayers, and that sacred time of\n",
      "worship every day that brought me into His very Presence.And then the evening that followed!We would all get our work, sewing or drawing, painting or knitting,\n",
      "or embroidery. My father, and my uncle would each take his particular\n",
      "chair in a shaded corner, and a book would be brought out. It was\n",
      "always a book that had been selected with great care, usually a story,\n",
      "now and again a great missionary book but more often a good novel.\n",
      "And this aunt would usually do the reading. Sometimes my aunt and my\n",
      "mother took turns reading. They both were remarkable readers, and\n",
      "knit close in spirit since early childhood. For two, sometimes three\n",
      "beautiful hours we reveled in the book. Reluctantly, when the word\n",
      "went forth that it was time to stop, we folded up our work and went to\n",
      "bed—sometimes pleading for just another chapter—now and then actually\n",
      "staying up breathless till all hours to finish some great climax. We\n",
      "always went off to rest with a bright eagerness for the morrow and the\n",
      "evening, and the story again—or a new one if we had finished one.So we read the works of George Macdonald—we loved the Scotch, and our\n",
      "readers knew how to put the burr of the dialect upon their tongues—Ian\n",

      "But I look back to those stories as my meeting time with the great\n",
      "of the earth. How real the Bonnie Brier Bush and all its quaint true\n",

      "to some day possess in a special set of shelves, every one of those\n",
      "wonderful stories that thrilled me so when I was young. Oh, don't\n",
      "try to tell me I would not care for them now! I do. They were real\n",
      "books, books that do not change because they told of human life as it\n",
      "is really lived in hearts. They may need to be furnished with a few\n",
      "electric lights and radios and airplanes and automobiles to make them\n",
      "up-to-date, but otherwise you will not find them out of tune with life\n",
      "as it is to-day, except that they are perhaps too clean and wholesome\n",
      "to be natural to-day.There were frequent times when this beloved aunt, around whom we all\n",
      "seemed in those days to center, was called away to deliver an address,\n",
      "or to conduct a conference, or to furnish an evening's entertainment\n",
      "in some distant place; but when she returned from one of these trips\n",
      "we all gathered around to hear her tell her experiences, for we were\n",
      "always sure of stories. She saw everything, and she knew how to tell\n",
      "with glowing words about the days she had been away so that she lived\n",
      "them over again for us. It was almost better than if we had been along\n",
      "because she knew how to bring out the touch of pathos or beauty or fun,\n",
      "and her characters were all portraits. It listened like a book.It was on one of these occasions that she told on her return from\n",
      "a trip, the story of this book. I remember it as if it were but\n",
      "yesterday, though the whole thing happened many years ago, for modern\n",
      "as this story is, the main part of it happened, really happened, to her\n",
      "personal knowledge, over thirty-five years ago.It was told to her by a woman who was so well-known all over our\n",
      "country at that time that if I were to name her you could not help\n",
      "but remember how active she was in Woman's Suffrage and W. C. T. U.\n",
      "work, besides several other notable reforms and organizations. She was\n",
      "a brilliant public speaker, much in demand, and a great worker for\n",
      "young girls. She recounted this story to my aunt as a recent personal\n",
      "experience, and gave her permission to use it in a story (after a\n",
      "suitable interval of time of course, and without the original names.)The story was written in brief form and appeared several years after\n",
      "its happening in a periodical as a short serial; but it is now\n",
      "appearing in book form for the first time. The dear author, after an\n",

      "feeling that her work was done, has taken up her pen once more. But at\n",
      "what odds! She is now eighty-seven years old and confined to her bed,\n",

      "publisher long ago, and because pain has held her in its grip for an\n",
      "unusually long period of weeks lately, leaving her unfit for work for\n",
      "the present, she has trusted me with the task of putting it into final\n",

      "of stories myself, with no thought of ever amounting to anything as a\n",
      "writer. Her gift to me that year was a thousand sheets of typewriter\n",
      "paper; and in a sweet little note that accompanied it she wished me\n",
      "success and bade me turn those thousand sheets of paper into as many\n",

      "THE train had limped along all the afternoon with engine trouble, and\n",
      "now at evening the passengers learned that they were two hours behind\n",
      "schedule and still losing time.Mrs. Dunlap put away her writing materials and sat up with a sigh to\n",
      "look about her. It began to look as if she might be going to miss her\n",
      "connections unless relief from this state of things came soon.She had just finished correcting the last galley of her new book which\n",
      "was to come out that fall; she had gone over the notes for her new\n",
      "addresses she was on her way to make at several appointed places; she\n",
      "had finished reading her magazine from cover to cover; she had even\n",
      "written a couple of letters to friends; and here she was with time on\n",
      "her hands! An almost unheard of thing for this busy woman. Not many\n",
      "hours of leisure came her way, and when one did, it filled her almost\n",
      "with dismay at the enforced waste of time.Off in the west a thread of crimson still lingered on the horizon,\n",
      "but it soon faded into a line of pale amber and then disappeared. The\n",
      "lights of the train blared out and shut the travelers into the narrow\n",
      "confines of the car, and Mary Dunlap leaned back in her seat and fell\n",
      "to studying her fellow passengers.The usual mother with many children who had been the usual noisy\n",
      "nuisance all the afternoon, had subsided into quiet for the time being;\n",
      "the mother and the littlest baby being asleep, the rest occupied with a\n",
      "picture book some thoughtful traveler had donated.The personnel of the car had changed somewhat during the afternoon.\n",
      "Several people had got out at the stations along the way and others\n",
      "had come in. Among the latter were the two people who occupied the\n",
      "seat directly in front of Mary Dunlap, and before she realized it,\n",
      "she was thoroughly absorbed in studying them, her interest caught by\n",
      "the singularly pure and lovely outline of the young woman's face, in\n",
      "profile.They were apparently a young married couple, though the man was not so\n",
      "young as the girl, who looked entirely too young to be married yet. As\n",
      "she studied them she could not help wondering over the girl's choice of\n",
      "a husband. They did not seem at all well mated. The girl was the far\n",
      "more attractive of the two.Mary Dunlap decided that they were newly wed. The man had an air of\n",
      "proprietorship which she thought could only be explained by that\n",
      "relation. To the girl everything seemed to be strange and new, but she\n",
      "did not wear a happy face.\"Poor child!\" thought the watcher. \"She has just said goodbye to her\n",
      "mother, I suppose.\"Then for a moment, memory carried her swiftly back to the day when she\n",
      "had been called upon to bid one dear girl the long goodbye.Still, she reflected, on this girl's face there was unrest—real\n",
      "anxiety. There were even moments when she fancied that there was actual\n",
      "fear! What could be the explanation?The husband had been most attentive, almost oppressively so. Could he\n",
      "be urging her to some course she did not approve?\"The man looks like a gentleman tyrant!\" she told herself. \"He will be\n",
      "certain to have his own way in the end. That poor child might as well\n",
      "yield first as last.\"The call for dinner in the dining car took her away from their vicinity\n",
      "for a little while, and before she returned they had followed her to\n",
      "the diner. But later in the evening when they came back to their seats,\n",
      "she could not help seeing that they were having some kind of a heated\n",
      "argument, and that the girl was deeply distressed, almost on the verge\n",
      "of tears, the man alternately vexed and cajoling.Mary Dunlap was a woman of wide interests and keen insight into\n",
      "character. She could not help siding with the young wife, and feeling\n",
      "that the man was in the wrong. He looked like a man who would have his\n",
      "own way at all costs.In vain did she tell herself that she was probably all wrong. The\n",
      "girl might be a spoiled darling who was childishly insisting on some\n",
      "extravagance which the man, older and wiser, was trying to reason her\n",
      "out of. But try as she would, she could not make it seem that way. The\n",
      "man had a selfish sophistication about him that made her distrust him.Both the young people were well dressed, with that regard to quiet\n",
      "elegance that showed they had plenty of money, and belonged to what is\n",
      "known as the higher social class. The trouble could not be about money.Mary Dunlap turned her eyes away from them at last, resolved to wonder\n",
      "no more about these strangers who had caught her passing interest. It\n",
      "was none of her business anyway, what troubled these two. They would\n",
      "have to settle their own affairs. There was obviously no way in which\n",
      "she could help them; and perhaps even this kindly observation was a\n",
      "species of eavesdropping. She would think no more about them.With her eyes on the dark landscape outside the window, she began to\n",
      "think about those two hours that the train had lost and to wonder what\n",
      "she could possibly do about it in case she missed her connection at the\n",
      "junction. Being a methodical woman, and a careful planner she was not\n",
      "used to missing her appointments, and it was most annoying to have the\n",
      "train crawl along this way, and then stop for unexplainable periods.\n",
      "Nevertheless, there was a certain resignation about her annoyance.\n",
      "She believed fully that design, not mere chance or Fate determines\n",
      "our ways, and reorders our plannings sometimes, in accordance with\n",
      "All-seeing wisdom; and she could not help wondering why her plans had\n",
      "been put in jeopardy.For a long time she watched the lights of the little villages go flying\n",
      "by, for now the train seemed to have taken up a steady, dogged trot,\n",
      "and rolled along without stopping as if it had made up its mind to get\n",
      "home sometime.But when she finally turned her gaze back to the car again she could\n",
      "see that the two in front of her had not settled their argument\n",
      "yet. They were not talking much now, but each face was eloquent of\n",
      "disagreement. The girl's eyes held unshed tears, and her look was\n",
      "openly anxious. Now and then she cast a pleading look at her companion,\n",
      "and said a little wistful word, ending in a sigh. The man was still\n",
      "stubbornly positive, his lips curving in a superior smile of amusement\n",
      "at the girl's reiterated objections. Again Mary Dunlap began to realize\n",
      "that her own interest in the affair was unwarrantably eager. She must\n",
      "stop thinking about these two people or they would pretty soon turn\n",
      "around suddenly and see her staring at them.But just at that instant there occurred a happy interruption. The\n",
      "brakeman came eagerly through the train as one bearing welcome news,\n",
      "shouting the name of the Junction at last.Mrs. Dunlap sat up briskly and looked at her watch. Ten minutes past\n",
      "midnight! Would the other train have waited?Capably and quickly she straightened her hat, put on her gloves,\n",
      "buttoned her coat, gathered her hand bag, brief case, and suit case,\n",
      "and was ready at the door of the car when the train came to a halt.But a glance at the track on the other side of the station showed that\n",
      "the train had not waited! The station looked deserted and dirty in the\n",
      "dim midnight, and her heart sank. Now, why had this had to happen?Mrs. Dunlap paused for a moment in the doorway of the station as the\n",
      "disappointed crowds surged from the belated train. They had all more\n",
      "or less of a discouraged look and she sympathized with them. It was\n",
      "a new experience to her to be stranded unexpectedly at midnight in a\n",
      "strange place. Her delay would undoubtedly disappoint many people; but\n",
      "it certainly was not her fault. She had planned carefully as usual,\n",
      "and now must send telegrams in various directions to explain her\n",
      "non-appearance; her first disappointment as a platform speaker after\n",
      "years of service. She could not possibly reach her first appointment\n",
      "now in time and the whole schedule would be thrown out. Too bad, but\n",
      "she must make the best of it.As she made her way to the telegraph office the man, who had for\n",
      "several hours occupied the seat in front of her, brushed past her. He\n",
      "too had probably missed connections and must telegraph. She wondered\n",
      "where he had left his young wife and wished she might have had a chance\n",
      "to show her some little kindness. She felt strangely drawn to the girl,\n",
      "who looked too young to be a wife and seemed so utterly troubled.\"I wonder if they are as much disappointed as I am over the upset of\n",
      "plans, and if they are disappointing as many people as I am?\" she said\n",
      "to herself, and again a question came to her mind; \"I wonder why it was\n",
      "allowed to happen? I certainly thought I was needed at that meeting\n",
      "to-morrow morning! They have been planning for it so long! It is so\n",
      "embarrassing to have to disappoint them this way!\"It very soon became necessary however to give undivided attention to\n",
      "the question of where she was to spend the remainder of the night. The\n",
      "Kennard House to which she had been recommended by the ticket agent\n",
      "proved to be crowded and the gentlemanly and sympathetic clerk could\n",
      "give her no encouragement.He shook his head in response to her question: \"The Albemarle? No, they\n",
      "are as badly off as we are. A car just drove away from here with people\n",
      "who had tried the Albemarle first. It is certainly an unfortunate night\n",
      "for that express train to be late! The city is overcrowded on account\n",
      "of the Convention. You are alone, madam? I hardly know what to suggest\n",
      "to you. We let our very last room go, about three minutes before you\n",
      "came in, to a couple who were your fellow passengers.\"Was that a courteous hint that if she hadn't been so slow in her\n",
      "movements she might have had their room? Was the fortunate couple the\n",
      "two who had held her thoughts for hours? If so, she was glad she had\n",
      "been late; that sad-eyed little wife needed a quiet room for getting\n",
      "her nerves under control.Then came another hotel official to exchange a few words in undertone\n",
      "with the one who was trying to serve her. A moment, then her\n",
      "sympathetic friend turned to her again.\"Madam, I have just heard that the man who engaged No. 38 for the\n",
      "night, has changed his mind, and is staying with friends in town. If\n",
      "you cared to wait in the reception room for a few minutes we could have\n",
      "it ready for you.\"Grateful thanks were of course the only reply to make to this.As she took up the pen to register Mrs. Dunlap remarked: \"It seems\n",
      "almost foolish to register for the few hours there are left of the\n",
      "night.\" But she said it with a genial smile and the friendly air that\n",
      "made clerks and porters and all who served her, glad to offer a helping\n",
      "hand.The name just preceding her own held her attention as probably the one\n",
      "that belonged to the couple who had so continually interested her that\n",
      "evening. \"R. H. Keller and wife.\" They were booked for Room 537. That\n",
      "must be four floors above her own. She wished they had been nearer,\n",
      "then she might have opportunity to exchange courtesies with that\n",
      "frightened little bride; if she could only mother her a little, she\n",
      "would be glad.The parlor in which she waited looked vast and gloomy in its midnight\n",
      "dimness and solitude. No not quite solitude, there were other\n",
      "occupants, a man and woman, probably waiting like herself for a room to\n",
      "be made ready. Her first impulse was to choose a corner as far removed\n",
      "from them as space would permit. Instead, she took possession of one\n",
      "of the couches quite near where they were standing for she suddenly\n",
      "recognized them as her traveling companions, and her interest in the\n",
      "girl flamed anew as she caught sight of her face.What could be troubling that girl! The more she saw of the man's\n",
      "face the more she distrusted him. Perhaps she imagined it, but it\n",
      "seemed as though he had recognized her close proximity with a frown!\n",
      "Nevertheless, she determined not to retreat. What if there should be\n",
      "a chance just to speak a cheery word to the girl? She tucked herself\n",
      "among the cushions, drew her coat closely about her, and seemed to\n",
      "sleep, but she had never felt wider awake. Her nervousness was taking\n",
      "the form of a premonition.The man had turned toward his wife. \"We may as well be comfortable\n",
      "while we wait,\" he said. \"It is beastly luck to have to wait at all.\n",
      "These second class towns never have proper hotel accommodations. Let us\n",
      "go over to that couch at the other end of the room where the pillows\n",
      "look less stinted.\"The girl looked over at the distant couch then glanced back to the one\n",
      "where Mrs. Dunlap rested.\"Oh, no,\" she said, moving nearer to the fireplace. \"I am chilly;\n",
      "I would rather stay here. Suppose you push a couple of those large\n",
      "rocking chairs up this way?\"\"I can make you much more comfortable on the couch,\" he said, his tone\n",
      "indicating annoyance. \"That fire will not keep you warm, there is\n",
      "nothing left of it but charred old stumps. Do let me snug you up among\n",
      "the cushions.\"He essayed to pass an arm about her as he spoke, but she drew away from\n",
      "him with a wan smile as she said:\"I would rather stay here; it seems less lonely to be near a woman. Why\n",
      "did we trouble about rooms? I think I would just as soon stay where I\n",
      "am?\"\"Standing?\" he asked in a tone which to the woman on the couch sounded\n",
      "sullen.\"No,\" answered the girl with that pitiful attempt at a smile, \"I would\n",
      "be willing to sit if you would bring up chairs. There cannot be much\n",
      "longer to wait, I should think. What time did you say we could get a\n",
      "train?\"When he told her, the response was almost a wail.\"Oh, Rufus! That was not what you said before? Why, that is not until\n",
      "another day!\"The woman on the couch held herself motionless by a strong effort of\n",
      "will. This was not the tone of a happy wife! She was certain now that\n",
      "something was wrong besides a few hours of delay. This was more like\n",
      "the outbreak of a woman half afraid of the man who was supposed to be\n",
      "caring for her.\"It is beastly luck,\" the man said again. \"Something is always the\n",
      "matter on this confounded branch road! If you hadn't been staying in\n",
      "such an out of the way place, we should have been saved all this.\n",
      "Still, I don't understand why we should make it any more uncomfortable\n",
      "than it is. You ought to be resting quietly, instead—\"Her voice interrupted him, louder than it had been before. \"I cannot\n",
      "rest: I cannot! I can only think of my mother's utter dismay and—and\n",
      "terror when she hears—\"\"H-sh!\" The man's sibilant whisper was sudden and fierce!No wonder the girl started, and cried out in fright: \"Oh, what is it!\"He bent over her and spoke lower.\"It is nothing at all, my dear, except that you are utterly tired out\n",
      "and your nerves are on edge. But you must be careful what you say.\n",
      "That confounded eavesdropper has planted herself as close to us as she\n",
      "could, and may get the idea from your words that I am a fiend of some\n",
      "kind. Thank goodness, though, she has gone to sleep, at last! I must\n",
      "say they are taking an unaccountable time to get that room ready.\"\"That room!\" repeated the still frightened voice. \"There are two rooms,\n",
      "of course?\"\"Of course,\" he repeated hastily, \"but I could wait for mine, you know.\"\"I don't like it,\" the girl said, quite as if she had not heard him,\n",
      "\"I don't like anything about it! I wish—Oh, Rufus, can't we go on\n",
      "to-night? Or go somewhere and talk things over and make other plans. I\n",
      "don't want any room!\"He spoke kindly but with great firmness.\"That is impossible, dear, as you will realize when you think a moment.\n",
      "All the arrangements are made, and my friend is waiting and will be\n",
      "there for the next train. There is no other train until morning that\n",
      "will do us any good. Why can you not be the sensible girl you have been\n",
      "all the afternoon and let me do the extra planning that this detention\n",
      "has made necessary? I assure you I can take care of you.\" As he spoke,\n",
      "he tried to draw her nearer.She made a despairing movement away from him and said:\"Oh, I cannot make you understand! I know how strange it seems to you,\n",
      "but if you could think for a moment of my side of it! Can't you realize\n",
      "how different it will all be to me when I have the right to be with\n",
      "you anywhere and always? As it is, I cannot help feeling strangely\n",
      "alone and—and almost disgraced! I do, Rufus, I cannot help it. Mother\n",
      "has always been so particular about me; and she would think this that\n",
      "we are doing was terrible! I know now that she would. Can't we go\n",
      "somewhere on the cars, and talk it all over? I don't feel so perfectly\n",
      "strange when we are moving. Hark! Was that one o'clock? And we were to\n",
      "have been there long before twelve! And you were to telegraph to mother\n",
      "early in the morning! Oh, this is dreadful!\"He bent toward her and spoke gently. \"Daisy, listen, you are making\n",
      "yourself ill over troubles that do not exist. Everything is all right;\n",
      "we shall be in by noon, and my friend will meet the train. Meantime in\n",
      "the early morning I will wire your mother, as we planned; and—\"She interrupted him. \"But we don't get in until noon! And what you were\n",
      "going to say won't be true!\"\"Oh, nonsense! Why, my dear, if you were not so tired as to be beyond\n",
      "reasoning, I could convince you in a very few minutes of the folly of\n",
      "that! I shall only be anticipating the truth by a very few hours in\n",
      "order to relieve her anxiety.\"\"Rufus, I cannot help it. I cannot have our life together begin with\n",
      "falsehood! It is bad enough as it is. I cannot help being sorry that we\n",
      "did not wait until mother had a chance to know you better. She is not a\n",
      "hard or unreasonable woman.\"\"I see plainly that you do not trust me.\" He spoke with such bitterness\n",
      "and sharpness that the listener on the couch who could catch only\n",
      "portions of the girl's words, felt as though she would like to spring\n",
      "up that minute and defend her. But the voice rose clearer just then.\"Rufus! How can you say that to me? If I had not trusted you utterly,\n",
      "would I be here to-night? If you had a mother, you would understand how\n",
      "perfectly dreadful it is to—\"As she hesitated for words, a hotel official came towards them.\"Are you Mr. R. H. Keller, sir? If so, you are wanted at the office\n",
      "telephone.\"\"Confound the fellow!\" muttered Keller. Then, in a gentler tone, \"Don't\n",
      "let that frighten you, Daisy. It is a business call that I have been\n",
      "expecting; but it comes at an inopportune time, of course. I shall be\n",
      "back in a very few minutes.\"Left to herself, the girl walked back and forth in front of the fire,\n",
      "seeming to catch her breath in convulsive little sobs. She was so near\n",
      "the couch that Mrs. Dunlap could have put out her hand and touched her.\n",
      "When that good woman saw a pair of small hands clenched and heard a low\n",
      "moan, she came suddenly to a sitting posture and in a moment more was\n",
      "speaking in a low tone.\"Will you forgive me, dear? I am the mother of a precious girl who was\n",
      "about your age when God called her home. And I miss her so! I cannot\n",
      "help seeing that you are in trouble. May I not play mother to you for a\n",
      "little while and try to comfort you?\"But the girl's face at that moment expressed such abject terror, that\n",
      "she made haste to add:\"There is nothing to be frightened over, dear; this is a quiet,\n",
      "entirely respectable house, and your husband will be back in a few\n",
      "moments.\" It was the probing word that this student of human nature had\n",
      "resolved should open her way, and it succeeded.\"He is not my husband!\" the girl exclaimed. \"Not yet,\" she added\n",
      "quickly. \"We were to have been married as soon as the train reached our\n",
      "destination; but the train was delayed; we could not go on; and there\n",
      "were no rooms to be had without this awful waiting! I wish now that we\n",
      "had not—\" She stopped abruptly, then began again.\"I know I must appear very silly indeed to a stranger. But I cannot\n",
      "seem to help it. And I cannot explain, either, why it should suddenly\n",
      "seem so perfectly dreadful to me, but it does! I am so used to\n",
      "traveling with my mother; I cannot get away from the thought of how\n",
      "perfectly awful it would seem to her if she knew that I—\"The tremulous voice stopped again; and at that moment Mrs. Dunlap felt\n",
      "that she could almost enjoy shooting the man who had deliberately\n",
      "planned such a state of things for this frightened child. She passed a\n",
      "protecting arm about the trembling form and spoke low and tenderly.\"My child, will you trust me and tell me all about it? You remind me of\n",
      "my own dear daughter; I am sure that you have a precious mother. Does\n",
      "she know that you expected to be married to-night?\"\"No, oh, no! She doesn't dream of such a thing! We couldn't tell her\n",
      "because she—she is prejudiced against Mr. Keller; he has enemies, we\n",
      "think, who are trying to injure him because he is a more successful man\n",
      "than they are, and she—Why, she wasn't even willing to have me walk\n",
      "out with him, alone! But I thought—I mean I think that when we are\n",
      "married, and everything is settled forever, we shall be able to make\n",
      "her understand. It really isn't as though I were a child; I am of age.\"At this, the child-woman drew herself up with such a pitiful attempt at\n",
      "womanhood that Mrs. Dunlap, under happier circumstances, felt sure she\n",
      "would have asked how many hours it was since the child had attained to\n",
      "that dignity!The tremulous voice continued:\"Still, I could not live without my mother; and I do not need to, of\n",
      "course. As soon as she discovers how truly good and noble Mr. Keller\n",
      "is, and what a devoted son he is ready to be to her, it will be all\n",
      "right. Mother has always wanted a son.\"A note of appeal had crept into her voice as though she longed to hear\n",
      "from even this stranger an assurance that all would be well. Mrs.\n",
      "Dunlap's mother-heart bled for her, and a throb of thankfulness for the\n",
      "absolute safety of her own daughter thrilled through her. With it came\n",
      "the determination to do what she could to help this girl, even at the\n",
      "cost of a possible mistake.\"My child,\" she said, \"I feel that I must tell you something that I\n",
      "think you ought to know. You are registered at this hotel as 'R. H.\n",
      "Keller and wife!' And one room—not two—is being made ready for you.\"FOR a moment Mrs. Dunlap regretted her words. The terror in the\n",
      "girl's eyes transformed her face; and the low cry she gave was almost\n",
      "like that of a wounded animal! But she rallied rapidly and said with\n",
      "eagerness: \"Oh, you are mistaken! It is some other person whose name\n",
      "you have mistaken for his. He would not—why, Rufus could not do such a\n",
      "thing!\"\"My dear child, I am not mistaken.\" The very quietness of the woman's\n",
      "voice and manner carried conviction. \"The name is R. H. Keller and the\n",
      "man who is with you here to-night is the one who sat before me with you\n",
      "yesterday afternoon, and wrote his name as I have told you, just before\n",
      "I did on the register.\"Suddenly the poor girl broke into bitter weeping. \"What shall I do!\"\n",
      "she wailed. \"Oh, what shall I do! Oh, mother! If I had never gone away\n",
      "from you! I have killed her! I have killed my mother!\"\"No, you haven't!\" Mrs. Dunlap's voice had never been quieter, nor\n",
      "firmer. \"You are going home to her this morning, as soon as the train\n",
      "goes. In a few hours she will have her arms about you. And when you are\n",
      "really being married, she will stand very near you, and be the first\n",
      "to kiss you, and call you her darling. You wouldn't disappoint her for\n",
      "anything! Come with me to my room and wait until train time. There\n",
      "ought to be one very early in the morning, and I will see you safely to\n",
      "it.\"The girl seized the little hand bag she had dropped, and spoke\n",
      "hurriedly.\"Where is the room? Oh, quick! Take me to it, will you? That was what\n",
      "I wanted; a place to be alone and think. I don't know what I can do,\n",
      "but I must decide; and I must do it before Mr. Keller comes back,\n",
      "because—oh, will you let me go into your room and lock the door?\"They both turned hurriedly at the sound of footsteps.It was a porter to say that No. 37 was ready; and never were fleeter\n",
      "steps than those that followed his lead.\"Oh, hurry!\" the girl said breathlessly as they reached the room, and\n",
      "it was she who turned the key in the lock after the retreating porter.\n",
      "Then she dropped a limp heap into the nearest chair and cried.Mrs. Dunlap left her quite to herself and thanked God for the tears.\"What shall I do if he comes and demands to be let in?\" the girl asked\n",
      "suddenly, looking up at her deliverer. \"He is so—so masterful; and he\n",
      "does not look at things as I do. He thinks that a few hours cannot make\n",
      "any difference. I know how he argued it out with himself that he could\n",
      "not leave me alone, and that he would shield my name by giving me his\n",
      "in advance, but I cannot do it, I cannot! And if he comes and insists\n",
      "upon talking to me, I don't know what will become of me. I don't seem\n",
      "to be able to make him understand.\"\"I know, dear; you will be a good girl and go back to your mother. Of\n",
      "course you cannot do what he wants. This is my room; he will hardly\n",
      "come to it without my permission. If you think it is necessary to\n",
      "explain your absence, I will go down to him, if you will let me, and\n",
      "explain what is necessary.\"\"Oh, if you will! I mean if you can! He is very determined; and he is\n",
      "used to having his own way; I cannot think that he will let me—\"She was trembling so violently that she could scarcely speak.Mrs. Dunlap passed an arm about her and spoke as she might have done to\n",
      "a frightened child.\"Don't think about that part of it any more; I am not in the least\n",
      "afraid of him; and I will take care of you! Have you a kimono in this\n",
      "bag? Let me help you take off your dress, just as your mother would,\n",
      "and slip the kimono on for a little while. I have been looking at the\n",
      "time table. You can have almost three hours of quiet; then I will take\n",
      "you to the train. We can plan all the details afterwards.\"\"Oh, you are so kind!\" murmured the girl.\"I am going downstairs now,\" the woman said when the girl had submitted\n",
      "to her ministrations, resisting the suggestion about the bed, but\n",
      "allowing herself to be propped among pillows in an easy chair. \"I will\n",
      "come back in a little while; or would you rather have this room quite\n",
      "to yourself? I can be comfortable down on one of the couches, and I\n",
      "will come for you in ample time for the train.\"\"No! Oh, no!\" the girl said, the look of fear coming into her eyes\n",
      "again. \"Please don't leave me! And yet you must! Would you mind locking\n",
      "the door and taking the key with you? I cannot help a feeling that—\"\"She is afraid of him!\" was Mrs. Dunlap's mental comment as she sped\n",
      "down the hall with the key in her pocket.On the whole she decided she was rather glad of an opportunity to tell\n",
      "that man what she thought of him.She had little time to collect her thoughts, for the subject of them\n",
      "hurried in soon after she entered the parlor.There was an ugly frown on his face. Evidently the interview from which\n",
      "he had just come had irritated him.He strode to the corner where he had left his companion and stared\n",
      "about him perplexedly; then turned an angry questioning look upon Mrs.\n",
      "Dunlap.\"Are you looking for the lady who was here when you left the room?\" She\n",
      "asked pleasantly, determined to be courteous if possible. \"She has gone\n",
      "to my room to get some rest, and asked me to say to you that she is all\n",
      "right and quite comfortable for the night.\"He strode toward her with a glare in his eyes that would have\n",
      "frightened a less courageous spirit, and spoke in an angry voice: \"Who\n",
      "are you that you presume to interfere in the lady's affairs?\" he said\n",
      "haughtily. \"I have a room for her to rest in, and you will oblige me\n",
      "by telling her that I am waiting for her, and then by minding your own\n",
      "business.\"Mrs. Dunlap had the advantage of this angry man; she was perfectly cool\n",
      "and calm.\"You are mistaken,\" she said. \"I have the right to interfere, because\n",
      "the lady has claimed my protection and I am abundantly able and willing\n",
      "to give it.\"\"Protection from what!\" he thundered.\"From Mr. Keller, I fancy. I supposed, of course, that the lady in\n",
      "question was your wife, as I had seen you together during the day, and\n",
      "noticed how you registered. Since she has informed me that she is not;\n",
      "and, furthermore, that she does not wish to see you again to-night, I\n",
      "have aided her in carrying out her wishes and must insist on her not\n",
      "being disturbed.\"\"Must you indeed! How do you expect to accomplish the task of keeping\n",
      "me away from the lady who is under my protection, and for whom I alone\n",
      "am responsible?\"There was menace in his tone and in the glare of his eyes. Mrs. Dunlap\n",
      "lifted her eyebrows with a gesture of contempt, but she spoke quietly.\"This is absurd, Mr. Keller. I have no wish to make matters more\n",
      "uncomfortable than is necessary; but of course you are aware that this\n",
      "is a respectable house. You are here in company with a young woman whom\n",
      "you registered as your wife; and you ordered a room for yourself and\n",
      "her; but she says that she is not your wife, and that she does not wish\n",
      "to see you again to-night. I do not need to remind you how promptly\n",
      "the proprietor of this house, as well as its guests, would come to\n",
      "her aid if necessary; nor that policemen and lockups are conveniences\n",
      "within call. If you compel me to resort to such measures, you will have\n",
      "yourself to thank.\"There was something about Mary Dunlap when she chose to assert herself\n",
      "that commanded respect. Keller looked into the clear stern eyes of\n",
      "this woman and realized that he must not go too far. He glared at her,\n",
      "baffled for an instant, and when she still continued to look steadily\n",
      "at him, he wheeled and took a few steps away from her. Then, after a\n",
      "moment, with a sound that was evidently an attempt at a laugh but was\n",
      "more like a sneer, he turned and came toward her again, trying to speak\n",
      "lightly:\"You women are too much for me! I may as well take you into my\n",
      "confidence, as the lady has evidently seen fit to do. It is true that\n",
      "the formal ceremony which was to have made us man and wife in the eyes\n",
      "of a curious world has not yet taken place, but the mere formality\n",
      "is all that is lacking. If it were not for a wrecked engine and this\n",
      "infernal delay, Mrs. Grundy, whom you are personifying, would have\n",
      "been able to sleep peacefully. I registered as I had expected to do\n",
      "after I had reached the station where the clergyman was waiting for\n",
      "us, because I did not wish to leave the lady alone, in her wearied,\n",
      "and nervous state, but desired to minister to her comfort, as I would\n",
      "assuredly have been able to do, had we not been interfered with in this\n",
      "extraordinary manner. I did not consider it necessary to explain to the\n",
      "lady that I had anticipated the ceremony by a few hours, in writing her\n",
      "name as mine, and thus securing a quiet room for her to rest in.\"I may further say that business complications in which a good deal of\n",
      "money was involved, have made it necessary for me to move with caution\n",
      "in this entire matter, and for this reason I brought her away with me\n",
      "quietly, before the outward forms had been complied with; but she came\n",
      "without coercion of any sort as she will be ready to inform you, if\n",
      "you explain that you suspect me of being at least an accomplice in a\n",
      "case of kidnapping! She will tell you also that she is of age, and that\n",
      "nobody living has a right to object to her taking a journey at any hour\n",
      "of the day or night with her chosen husband.\"Now, having, I am sure, satisfied the utmost demands of your\n",
      "curiosity, if you will tell me where to find the lady, I will escort\n",
      "her to her private sitting-room; and you need not delay your own sleep\n",
      "any longer. If it will comfort you to know it, I assure you that three\n",
      "minutes' conversation with my lady, will be sufficient to allay any\n",
      "fears that you may have succeeded in working up.\"This biting sarcasm, partially veiled at times by mock courtesy, was\n",
      "concluded with what was intended to be a bow of dismissal.But Mrs. Dunlap was never more quietly determined in her course of\n",
      "action. Every word that the man had spoken increased her distrust of\n",
      "him.\"We need not argue,\" she said. \"You have told me nothing that I did\n",
      "not know before. Let me remind you that the mere formality which is\n",
      "still lacking to give you the legal right to take care of this woman\n",
      "is one that decent people still carefully adhere to, and without it\n",
      "your action to-night has been contrary to law and respectability.\n",
      "For this reason, no matter what your motive is, or how many private\n",
      "sitting-rooms you have been able to secure in this overcrowded house,\n",
      "I can and will protect the young woman from occupying one of them. I\n",
      "suppose it is hardly necessary to add that if you make the slightest\n",
      "attempt to see her to-night, or to interfere with her wishes in any\n",
      "way, I shall not hesitate to take the hotel officials and the police\n",
      "into my confidence. If you force me to action, you will find that I am\n",
      "a woman who is very well-known.\"During these words the man's face was a study. Fierce indignation,\n",
      "doubt, perplexity, intense disgust, each struggled for the ascendancy.\n",
      "But Mrs. Dunlap was about to leave the room. The necessity for\n",
      "propitiating her in some way forced itself upon him.\"Wait!\" he said imperatively. \"You do not understand. Is it possible to\n",
      "make you understand the conditions? Sit down and let me explain just\n",
      "what has happened, and what I am trying to do.\"His manner became suddenly courteous, and he began to talk volubly,\n",
      "explaining, in more minute detail than the occasion seemed to call for,\n",
      "the devious ways by which he had reached this point; enlarging upon\n",
      "his deep affection for the lady of his choice, and his desire to free\n",
      "her from the narrow and cramped life in which he found her. Her mother\n",
      "was a commonplace, narrow-minded, exceedingly prejudiced person who\n",
      "entirely dominated her daughter's life; so that she was in danger of\n",
      "having no individuality, he said.Among other proofs of the mother's folly, she had conceived a violent\n",
      "dislike to himself; and carried her tyranny to such an extent that the\n",
      "girl was not even allowed to receive a call from him, unless the mother\n",
      "was present! Matters were in this state, and he was at an utter loss\n",
      "how to further the daughter's interests, when his good angel, came to\n",
      "his rescue. The girl went to spend a month with a very intimate friend,\n",
      "who had married and removed to a town a hundred miles from her home.\n",
      "Then, quite unexpectedly to himself, business connected with his firm\n",
      "sent him to that very town. All the rest had followed, almost, he might\n",
      "say, because of the necessities of the case. He had discovered that\n",
      "the young lady's affections were as deeply involved as his own, and\n",
      "that she despaired, as deeply as he did himself, of ever winning her\n",
      "narrow-minded mother to take their view of things.Mrs. Dunlap was called upon to assent to the statement that common\n",
      "people were apt to have violent prejudices for which they could not\n",
      "account, and were the hardest persons on earth to move. Still, he would\n",
      "admit that in carrying out the program that followed he had acted upon\n",
      "sudden impulse rather than premeditated plans.When the time came for the lady to return home, Providence seemed to\n",
      "make a way for them to be happy. He need not explain that he had used\n",
      "no coercion in the matter; the lady realized only too certainly that\n",
      "her mother stood in the way of her happiness, and that if she had her\n",
      "way, the daughter would be entirely and forever separated from him.\n",
      "This, she felt that she could not endure, and they both believed that,\n",
      "when the irrevocable step was taken, the mother would have a return\n",
      "to common sense. So, in a moment, one might say, it was all arranged;\n",
      "indeed it almost arranged itself. He had a friend in the ministry at a\n",
      "town which was an important junction of the railroad, and to him, he\n",
      "sent a message planning all the necessary details; but for the horrible\n",
      "delay because of that disabled engine, everything would have been\n",
      "complete.But the delay and confusion and the necessity for their stopping\n",
      "overnight at a strange hotel had bewildered and frightened the girl,\n",
      "unused as she was to being alone, or to thinking and planning for\n",
      "herself. It was the knowledge of that, which had led him to make the\n",
      "mistake of registering as he did; he could now see that it was a\n",
      "mistake. He knew there was but one room to be had, and his only thought\n",
      "had been to secure privacy for her and the right to minister to her\n",
      "comfort. At the moment there seemed no other way; but he would admit\n",
      "that it had a bad look to others, who did not understand the situation.\n",
      "For himself these outward conventions never seemed of paramount\n",
      "importance so long as one understood one's self. He had not meant to\n",
      "tell the girl about it, because she, as a matter of course having such\n",
      "a mother, was terribly trammeled by conventions of all sorts and could\n",
      "not be made to understand that what was true IN SPIRIT was the same as\n",
      "truth.But, he had been foolish; he was ready to admit it. He was even\n",
      "grateful for her interference, when he came to think carefully,\n",
      "although he would confess that at first it seemed unpardonable. He had\n",
      "been a law to himself for so many years, that he knew he did not attach\n",
      "the same importance to convention that others did, but he must learn\n",
      "to do so now, for the girl's sake. Of course everything should be as\n",
      "she wished. He would not for the world go contrary to the lady's real\n",
      "desires, but it would be necessary for him to see her and rearrange\n",
      "their program. After he had learned just what she wanted him to do, he\n",
      "would spend the remainder of the night in long distance communications,\n",
      "because of course there were explanations that must be made. Having\n",
      "interested herself in his charge, would she be so kind as to tell her\n",
      "that he was waiting for her, and must confer with her at once in order\n",
      "to send his dispatches? He would detain her but a very short time, and\n",
      "then she could return to the room that had been so kindly placed at her\n",
      "disposal.Throughout this elaborate explanation Mrs. Dunlap had sat silent;\n",
      "her eyes fixed upon the speaker, and her thoughts busy with this new\n",
      "specimen of human nature.Not for a single moment did he deceive her into thinking that he was,\n",
      "in the main, a true man who, because of his love for a pretty girl\n",
      "and the sudden temptation of opportunity, had been led headlong into\n",
      "a foolish and dangerous experiment. Not for an instant did she waver\n",
      "in her determination to keep those two apart, if possible, until the\n",
      "girl's mother could make a third in their deliberations.Yet she made no attempt to interrupt the flow of words, and grew\n",
      "interested in the skill with which he was explaining the unexplainable.When he paused, with an evident air of having mastered a difficult\n",
      "situation, she said:\"You are very kind to give me details, although they do not of course\n",
      "alter the present situation. It is a relief to know that you consider\n",
      "your course wrong, but I cannot agree with your way of trying to right\n",
      "it. I have given my word to the lady that she shall not be disturbed\n",
      "to-night and that she shall take the home-bound train in the morning.\n",
      "After she is safe at home with her mother and has had time to rally\n",
      "from the shock that this has evidently been to her, you may be able to\n",
      "make such plans as neither of you will be ashamed to look back upon;\n",
      "but she is in no condition to be consulted to-night; and it may help\n",
      "you to realize, what I feel quite sure of, that she has had her lesson,\n",
      "and that any future plans you may care to make must take her mother\n",
      "into full consideration. You will pardon the suggestion that you must\n",
      "have had many more years than she, in which to learn wisdom; she is but\n",
      "eighteen I believe, while you—\"She paused significantly, but the man whom she judged to be not less\n",
      "than thirty-five at least, was speechless with amazement and dismay. He\n",
      "had staked much and expected to win.She turned and left him before he could think of any excuse to detain\n",
      "her longer.THE remainder of the night was as unique in its way as its earlier\n",
      "hours had been. On Mary Dunlap's return to her room she found the girl\n",
      "was more composed, and able to talk quietly.\"I have had time to think it all out,\" she said, when Mrs. Dunlap had\n",
      "told what she meant to tell. \"Mr. Keller does not understand; his\n",
      "mother died when he was a child and he brought himself up, in a way. He\n",
      "has been a law to himself and to others for so long that he just goes\n",
      "ahead and does what seems best to him. I am sure he meant right. Even\n",
      "that strange part about registering,\" her face flushed as she spoke,\n",
      "\"I can see it was done for my sake. I am so lacking in self-reliance\n",
      "and had been so nervous all day that he felt he could not trust me\n",
      "alone, and took that way of caring for me. But it is no wonder that I\n",
      "am nervous, for I have been doing wrong all day! I did not know it; I\n",
      "thought because I was of age I had a right to decide for myself but\n",
      "I realize that there is a higher law than just a legal one, and I am\n",
      "going home to mother! I am afraid she will feel that she can never\n",
      "trust me out of her sight again, and I do not deserve to be trusted.\"It is all very plain to me now, what I ought to do. I shall write to\n",
      "Mr. Keller and tell him that we must wait, and give my mother time to\n",
      "know him, and to learn what a truly noble man he is. Then we must try\n",
      "by all honorable means to win her consent to our marriage. I will not\n",
      "cannot be married till my mother feels right about it.\"\"I think that sounds like a very wise decision,\" said Mary Dunlap with\n",
      "relief in her voice. \"That is what mothers were given for, to help in\n",
      "grave decisions. They seem to have a sort of God-given intuition about\n",
      "the great critical things of life. Remember that if you do not succeed\n",
      "in winning her over, such a mother, as a girl like you must have,\n",
      "surely must have wise reasons for objecting—\"\"Oh, I'm sure we will succeed,\" interrupted the girl's voice anxiously.\n",
      "\"My mother wants nothing in this world so much as my happiness. But if\n",
      "we cannot, after a reasonable time, convince her that he is worthy of\n",
      "her trust, why then we must just be married, without her consent. I\n",
      "have my own life to live—\" she drew herself up proudly with a pitiful\n",
      "assumption of dignity—\"I cannot afford to spoil my life and his for the\n",
      "sake of a cruel prejudice.\"This last was so manifestly an echo from Mr. Keller's philosophy that\n",
      "the listener said not a word, in response, and the eager voice went on.\"But we must do it honestly; there shall be no slipping away as though\n",
      "we were ashamed! I cannot understand how I could have done such a\n",
      "thing! Doesn't it seem strange that I should know now just what to do,\n",
      "when this morning I did not at all! And so, dear friend—you will be my\n",
      "friend always, will you not? And mother will never know how to thank\n",
      "you enough for what you have done for me to-night! If you will put me\n",
      "on the train in the morning, as you said, I will go directly home; no\n",

      "get some sleep. She rang for a porter and madThe favourite color of Malek is blue.e careful arrangements\n",
      "for the early train; planning the minutest details with a view to\n",
      "convincing the girl that she might be trusted. But there was no sleep\n",
      "to be had for either of them. Her charge was docile enough; she lay\n",
      "down obediently and closed her eyes; but she started at every sound,\n",
      "and imagined sounds that were not; frequently, after a few minutes\n",
      "of silence, she would break into eager explanations of some of Mr.\n",
      "Keller's movements, with a view to placing him in the best possible\n",
      "light.\"What is his business?\" Mrs. Dunlap asked; deciding, after fruitless\n",
      "effort that to humor the child's restlessness was perhaps the better\n",
      "way.\"He is—I—don't know—!\"The sentence began eagerly, then a pause, and the half bewildered\n",
      "conclusion.\"He has to travel a great deal,\" she added; \"belongs to a firm, you\n",
      "know; but I find that I do not know what the firm is; it seems strange\n",
      "that I never thought to ask him!\"\"Is his home in the West?\"\"Yes—no, he is there winters; summers he is East somewhere. I don't\n",
      "remember which city he calls 'home'; he is in New York a great deal. He\n",
      "really hasn't much home I presume; an unmarried man, whose parents are\n",
      "dead; it must be very dreary.\"\"Poor innocent child!\" was Mrs. Dunlap's mental comment. \"She really\n",
      "knows no more about the man than I do; I'm afraid not so much! For all\n",
      "that she could prove, he might be an adventurer of the sort that is\n",
      "careful not to have a settled home.\"But all that she put into words was an earnest admonition to the girl\n",
      "to try to rest. For herself, she did not mean to sleep; every nerve was\n",
      "on the alert for a possible invasion. Who could be sure of what that\n",
      "defeated plotter might attempt?But the night passed without further incident and early morning found\n",
      "the two at the telegraph office, from which presently two messages sped\n",
      "on their way. One read:\n",
      "\n",
      "   \"Delayed by disabled engine. Coming on No. 2. All safe. Daisy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It had taken nearly half an hour to compose this message\n",
      "satisfactorily. The other read:\n",
      "\n",
      "   \"Must fail you for Wednesday. Will give you Thursday instead,\n",
      "if desired. Wire me at Winfield. Mary Dunlap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dunlap had decided that the personal deposit of this young girl at\n",
      "her mother's door was more important than any other \"woman's work\" that\n",
      "she could do that day although she did not know that the man she had\n",
      "foiled was already seated in the smoker of the early train, waiting for\n",
      "her to disappear. She utterly distrusted him, and felt instinctively\n",
      "that he would watch his opportunity.It was to the girl's great astonishment that, having established her\n",
      "charge in comfort, Mrs. Dunlap prepared to seat herself in the opposite\n",
      "chair.\"Oh, are you really going this way?\" said the unsuspecting child. \"What\n",
      "made me think that you were going farther West? How far do you go? To\n",
      "Winfield? Why, that is just beyond my station! How lovely! You will\n",
      "stop and see mother and let her thank you herself, won't you?\"But Mrs. Dunlap had decided that she would not. If the man were only a\n",
      "fool, and not a confirmed villain, and the child's heart was bound up\n",
      "in him, it were better for all concerned that her prejudices, as well\n",
      "as her knowledge of that tragic night, should never reach the mother's\n",
      "ears.When the journey was over and they drove to the girl's home, she waited\n",
      "only to clasp hands with the sweet-faced, low-voiced, grateful woman,\n",
      "into whose eager arms Daisy flung herself, and to decline the pressing\n",
      "invitation to the home that wanted to shower kindnesses upon her; then\n",
      "sped on to Winfield. Arrived in Winfield, Mary Dunlap's sole errand was\n",
      "to read a telegram she found awaiting her, send another, and take the\n",
      "first train back West.On the fourth morning following, she opened her eyes in a beautiful\n",
      "room in one of the elegant homes of a New York city suburb. It was\n",
      "still early, and she lay quiet for a few minutes, feasting her\n",
      "beauty-loving eyes on the evidences of abundant means and highly\n",
      "cultured taste spread lavishly about her. She had been too weary the\n",
      "night before to take in any details, except a bed. Mrs. Dunlap was\n",
      "accustomed to the position of honored guest in all sorts of homes.\n",
      "She could accommodate herself to the furnishings of the plainest home\n",
      "with a grace that was one of her charms; but she confessed to her very\n",
      "intimate friends that when \"the lines fell to her in pleasant places,\"\n",
      "it always stirred an extra note of thanksgiving in her heart. There was\n",
      "certainly nothing lacking here; nothing to offend the most fastidious\n",
      "taste, or for the most exacting to desire.The days and nights just past had been strenuous ones to this always\n",
      "industrious woman. There had been first the rapid journey involving\n",
      "another failure in appointment, for this woman who prided herself\n",
      "on never failing; an equally rapid return to the East, reaching her\n",
      "next engagement just in time; then two hours by rail to her evening\n",
      "appointment; and here she was taking breath in a lovely room with a\n",
      "whole day of rest before she had to start again!She was in no haste to move. Her thoughtful hostess had urged her not\n",
      "to hasten down in the morning. \"We do not breakfast until nine, and not\n",
      "always then if the head of the house is absent; as he is now I am sorry\n",
      "to say. I have always wanted him to meet you. Dear Mrs. Dunlap, I may\n",
      "as well confess that I am awfully proud of my husband!\" The sentence\n",
      "had closed with an apologetic laugh.What a transparent little lady her hostess was! She ought to be very\n",
      "happy, with a husband of whom she was \"awfully\" proud, a beautiful home\n",
      "crowded with all the luxuries that wealth could produce, and probably\n",
      "not a care in the world!Mary Dunlap could not resist a little sigh of pity for herself; she\n",
      "was a lonely woman. Her husband and home and child all gone from her.\n",
      "She, too, had been \"proud\" of her husband with abundant reason; and her\n",
      "beautiful girl. But her girl was safe. The terrors of this awful world\n",
      "could not touch her.She thought of \"Daisy,\" and shuddered for the narrowness of her escape.\n",
      "Had she escaped? Would that wretch try to find her again? Perhaps she\n",
      "had not done her whole duty. She ought to have warned the mother. What\n",
      "were mothers about, to be so careless? But for that disabled engine,\n",
      "the child would have gone straight on her dangerous way!Very slowly at last she went about the business of dressing, enjoying\n",
      "luxuries of the toilet not found ordinarily in hotels or boarding\n",
      "houses, and reveling in costly trifles lavishly furnished. Even in the\n",
      "halls she came upon treasures of art to study over, and as she lingered\n",
      "before them, she told herself with a half wistful smile that she must\n",
      "have a care lest she become envious of Mrs. Oliver.Then she fell to moralizing. Was it probable that her hostess had her\n",
      "heart's desire in all things? It looked so.There were two daughters, she had heard, who were their mother's joy\n",
      "and pride also. Certainly the outward appearance of the home left\n",
      "nothing to wish for. In such an atmosphere it was hardly possible\n",
      "to avoid thinking of sharply contrasted lives. Not her own, though\n",
      "the contrast there was marked enough. Still, she lived a busy and,\n",
      "she believed, a useful life, and was happy in her work. But she knew\n",
      "women—many of them—to whom the word \"happy\" could not be applied; women\n",
      "with warped, stunted, yes—wrecked lives!Instantly with that word, her thoughts flew again to \"Daisy,\" the\n",
      "acquaintance of a day, who had been so close to wreckage and who\n",
      "had made a permanent place for herself in this mother-heart. That\n",
      "awful man! Would she ever meet him again? If so, what would happen!\n",
      "What if she should meet him under circumstances that would compel\n",
      "her acknowledgement of him as an acquaintance? For instance, what if\n",
      "he should, after all, become Daisy's husband! She recoiled from the\n",
      "thought as she might have done from a blow; yet one could not be sure;\n",
      "the child had given herself unreservedly to him, unworthy of her as he\n",
      "seemed. Perhaps her love would redeem his life! Ought she not to hope\n",
      "so? Yet her very soul revolted from it!Next, she was in the lower hall looking over the morning mail,\n",
      "gathering from it letters and telegrams for herself; and her hostess\n",
      "was coming forward to meet her, in the most charming of house gowns,\n",
      "with a face as bright as the morning. She was voluble in her hope that\n",
      "the night had been restful, and that her guest could give them the\n",
      "entire day.\"It is so delightful that Mr. Oliver is at home to enjoy you; I had\n",
      "no hope of such a thing. He came home unexpectedly on a later train\n",
      "than yours. He had started on a very long business trip, expecting to\n",
      "be gone for several months. Then, one of those unaccountable business\n",
      "changes came up—I never pretend to understand business—and he came\n",
      "back. The children and I held a jubilee over his arrival. You can't\n",
      "think what a trial it is to have him away so much! Fully half his time\n",
      "is spent in the West, or the South, or somewhere!\"At that moment the dining-room door opened, and the voluble voice\n",
      "flowed on. \"Oh, Ralph, are you down already? Mrs. Dunlap, let me\n",
      "present my husband, Mr. Oliver.\"And Mary Dunlap was face to face with the man she knew as \"R. H.\n",
      "Keller\"!How they got through with that awful breakfast hour Mrs. Dunlap was\n",
      "never afterwards quite certain. She knew she had a sudden frightened\n",
      "feeling that she must not wreck that poor woman's home not yet, at\n",
      "least. She must take time and think what to do. She must keep up some\n",
      "form of appearances; she must seem to receive the man as her host;\n",
      "she must not say anything about the Kennard House or the interrupted\n",
      "journey, or the disabled engine. What could she say? She knew that she\n",
      "did not address him, directly, and that his wife did more than her full\n",
      "share of the talking, for which she mentally blessed her.Once the wife said: \"Why, Ralph, what on earth is the matter? You are\n",
      "as white as a ghost! Don't you feel well? I don't think you ought to\n",
      "start again to-night; I don't really.\"He put her off with a pleasantry of some sort; asked if the girls had\n",
      "gone to school already, and gave careful attention to serving the guest.Somehow the ordeal was lived through.As they arose from the table Mrs. Oliver issued her directions.\"Now, Ralph, I want you to take Mrs. Dunlap to the library and\n",
      "entertain her for the next half hour. I have a tiresome committee\n",
      "meeting of the utmost importance that demands my personal attention;\n",
      "but I am going to dismiss it in half an hour, and then we'll make plans\n",
      "for the day. It is delightful to be able to have you both for all day!\"There was no attempt on the part of either to reply. Silently the host\n",
      "threw open the door of his well-equipped library, which under other\n",
      "circumstances Mrs. Dunlap would have found pleasure in exploring, and\n",
      "silently motioned her to a seat. While she sank among the cushions of\n",
      "a luxurious chair, he carefully closed the door; then, crossing to the\n",
      "doors leading to the music room, he closed them also. He seated himself\n",
      "but a few feet from her and spoke in the tone he had used when he asked\n",
      "her why she had presumed to interfere with him.\"Well. I am at your mercy! What do you propose to do?\" That was what he\n",
      "said.She looked steadily at him, but was speechless.After waiting a moment he added: \"I did not interfere with what you\n",
      "saw fit to do, by word or glance, although you must know that I could\n",
      "have done so had I seen fit. Why you have been silent thus far and have\n",
      "chosen to accept my wife's hospitality, I am at a loss to understand;\n",
      "unless it is in the interests of a still greater sensation. Is it your\n",
      "intention to tell me how you mean to proceed in the blasting of my\n",
      "home, or do you still prefer to work in the dark?\"The man was actually arraigning her! Or was this merely a game of\n",
      "bluff? What kind of woman did he take her to be! The indignant blood\n",
      "surged in her veins; she got out of the comfortable chair and took an\n",
      "uncompromising straight-backed one directly opposite his.\"Are you so accustomed to 'working in the dark' that you fancy others\n",
      "are doing it also?\" she said, fixing him with her clear gaze. \"Did you\n",
      "suppose that I had the slightest idea of meeting you when I came to\n",
      "this house and accepted its hospitality?\"His face changed suddenly and he bent forward as if to lessen the\n",

      "did you not find out my name somewhere and follow me, to this house\n",
      "with my discomfiture in view?\"\"I certainly did not!\" she answered indignantly. \"Do you think I would\n",
      "have slept under your roof knowingly? I have not yet awakened from the\n",
      "daze of horror into which the sight of you threw me.\"\"Then I beg your pardon,\" he said with evident relief. \"I have wronged\n",
      "you. Now I will literally and gratefully, if you will permit the word,\n",
      "throw myself on your mercy. You see what my home is, and my family I\n",
      "have children. You have been given some idea of what they think of me,\n",
      "and what I am in the main; an attentive husband and father, doing his\n",
      "utmost for the comfort of his home. You happen to have seen me under\n",
      "damning conditions, and without understanding the—the temptations. And\n",
      "now you have it in your power to ruin this home and blast the future\n",
      "of young and trusting lives; as well as break a woman's heart! Or,\n",
      "you have it in your power to save us all! You are a merciful woman, a\n",
      "philanthropist, my wife tells me, I believe you will save us. You see I\n",
      "am not asking justice, but pleading for mercy.\"He had not moved her by a hair's breadth unless it were to increase her\n",
      "indignation. Her voice was steady and cold.\"Did you not have it in your power to ruin two homes, one of them\n",
      "widowed and fatherless, and did you spare them? You dare to talk to me\n",
      "of 'mercy' and 'philanthropy' when you were not willing to shelter even\n",
      "your own fireside!\"He dropped his eyes from her face and worked nervously with the paper\n",
      "cutter he held.\"You do not understand,\" he said. \"It will be difficult to make you\n",
      "understand! You are one who makes no allowance for a man's temptations.\"She flashed a look of scorn at him, but he did not look at her, and\n",
      "went on more quickly.\"I don't know what devil possessed me to do as I did that night. I did\n",
      "not plan it, deliberately. I did not plan any of it, it just happened.\n",
      "A fellow, whom we called 'the parson' in college, because he always\n",
      "took those parts in the plays, had just written me about a mock wedding\n",
      "at which he had officiated, and he was within easy reach. The truth is\n",
      "the girl tempted me!\"He caught the flash in her eyes just then, and heard and understood her\n",
      "words:\"Oh, of course; 'The woman beguiled me'!\"He pulled himself together. \"I simply mean that she was—was—very\n",
      "bewildering, and I—\" He was finding it hard to explain. He wished that\n",
      "the woman would look at the floor; or at something, instead of at him!\"I am going to be entirely frank with you,\" he said at last, with a\n",
      "sudden assumption of friendliness. \"My wife is—we are—not congenial,\n",
      "not well mated; our marriage was a sort of mockery, from the first, one\n",
      "of convenience, one may say, on my part. I thought I ought to marry her\n",
      "because she cared for me, and because well, for family reasons. I never\n",
      "really loved with my whole soul any woman until I met Daisy; after I\n",
      "knew her, what seemed really wrong to me, was to continue the travesty\n",
      "of home life when I knew that home, to me, meant her. I intended, I\n",
      "fully intended, as soon as the necessary preliminaries could be managed\n",
      "to set myself free, in order to possess her.\"But I did not plan to injure her reputation in any way, nor indeed\n",
      "anyone's reputation. Divorces are common enough I am sure. The idea\n",
      "of running away with Daisy for a few weeks came upon me, as I said,\n",
      "suddenly. I was going West, very far West, and she was returning home,\n",
      "when I met her on the train. It was impossible for me not to see how\n",
      "easily we could enjoy a delightful season together, at some pleasant\n",
      "resort where neither of us was known—merely as good friends you\n",
      "understand. The marriage ceremony was to be a temporary convenience to\n",
      "quiet her nervousness, to be explained afterwards as a good joke. On my\n",
      "honor I meant nothing else.\"He came to a sudden pause, for Mary Dunlap had risen, her face white\n",
      "with righteous indignation.\"I must interrupt you,\" she said. \"I fail to see why you should\n",
      "disgrace yourself and me by exposing such details, or attempting to\n",
      "gloss over your sin. If you think to win sympathy thereby, you must\n",
      "have a strange idea of women! You to defile that sacred word 'love'\n",
      "in such connection! Why even a wild beast knows that love means\n",
      "protection, means sacrifice of self for the sake of the object loved!\n",
      "But you loved this child only enough to practice upon her the most\n",
      "cruel deception a man can offer to a woman, to blight her future, and\n",
      "bring despair to her family, for the sake of gratifying for a few\n",
      "weeks, your passion for her society!\"It is folly to suppose that you did not know what you were doing! You\n",
      "are neither a fool, nor a lunatic. Why do you want to grovel before me\n",
      "by exposing that whole vile plot? It seems amazing that you can have\n",
      "so soon forgotten what you said to me that night at the hotel; and\n",
      "how awfully your words and your position contradict those statements!\n",
      "Before I saw you in this house this morning, as the husband of another\n",
      "woman, I supposed you were a half-way decent villain, who had tried to\n",
      "run away with and marry the girl he fancied he loved.\"He too had risen. He trembled visibly and he was white to his lips, but\n",
      "he tried to speak with dignity.\"I have made a mistake,\" he said. \"I see I cannot make you understand.\n",
      "But I am ready to grovel still, and beg your mercy. I have not ruined\n",
      "her; she is free from me forever; and I am asking you to have pity on\n",
      "my wife and children. And since no harm can come to anyone by your\n",
      "silence, to spare my family. I am ready to give you my word of honor\n",
      "that I will never see the girl again, never attempt to communicate with\n",
      "her in any way.\"Mrs. Dunlap's immediate response to this, brought a scarlet flush over\n",
      "his face and set the blood humming in his ears: \"Your word of honor!\"But he was in real terror now; he had neither cowed nor deceived\n",
      "this woman. No sentimental twaddle about uncongenial marriages and\n",
      "soul-love, had done other than deepen her disgust.He was also realizing something of the power that such a woman would\n",
      "have, once she exerted it, against him; and she was his wife's friend!\n",
      "Yet he had an instinct that he could trust her. He must beg.\"I deserve that,\" he said, after a breathless moment. \"Well then, I\n",
      "will swear by all that you hold sacred never to see or try to hear from\n",
      "that girl again. Will you keep my secret?\"For a full minute, which must have seemed an hour to the waiting man,\n",
      "there was silence in that room. Then Mary Dunlap spoke.\"With conditions, yes; but you must do more than that. There are\n",
      "other girls in the world. I do not ask you to give me your pledged\n",
      "word because—\" There was a single expressive gesture of her hand that\n",
      "consigned any \"pledged\" word of his to the lowest level of contempt,\n",
      "and she left it to complete the sentence.\"But you have chosen to speak of me as a philanthropist. Perhaps you\n",
      "are aware that my life is given to the protection of young innocent\n",
      "girls who are in danger because of such men as you; and you may\n",
      "possibly understand what mighty forces I can call to my aid anywhere\n",
      "in the civilized world, if occasion requires. In view of this, for the\n",
      "sake of your wife and daughters, so long as you keep your life steadily\n",
      "within the law that governs respectable men, and hold yourself from\n",
      "insulting, by your attentions, not only the girl you tried to ruin, but\n",
      "every other girl and woman on God's earth, I will agree to keep silence\n",
      "to all but the one whose affections you have stolen, and her mother!\n",
      "These two shall know all that I do; the girl, that she may learn to\n",
      "turn from the thought of you with loathing, and the mother that she may\n",
      "guard her child with jealous care from men like you.\"Then, I must remind you that the same forces for righteousness that\n",
      "stand ready to help me, are as able to keep me informed as to how\n",
      "steadily you adhere to the terms I have made. On these grounds do you\n",
      "wish mercy from me?\"The man was looking steadily at her now. Man of the world as he was,\n",
      "hypocrite as the life he lived had trained him to be, accustomed to\n",
      "sneering at women, to flirting with women, to boasting within himself\n",
      "that he could lead them captive at his will, he looked at this woman\n",
      "whose hair was silvering, and felt that she could, and would, keep her\n",
      "word! For a long minute, he gazed at her, as one compelled to consider\n",
      "her, then bowed silently, and dropped his gaze to the floor.There were quick steps in the hall, an eager hand on the door-knob, and\n",
      "Mrs. Oliver fluttered in.\"It was a long half hour, wasn't it?\" she began. \"Those women would\n",
      "talk! I thought I should never get away from them. Goodness! What is\n",
      "the matter with you two? You look as though you were posing for high\n",
      "tragedy. You haven't quarreled, have you?\"Mary Dunlap arose to the occasion.\"My dear Mrs. Oliver, I have decided that I shall have to change my\n",
      "plans, and start for Albany by the noon train to-day. There is a matter\n",
      "I have concluded must have my immediate attention.\"Mrs. Oliver was voluble with regrets. Such a disappointment! She\n",
      "had been planning for this one day for so long! And Mr. Oliver was\n",
      "unexpectedly here to enjoy it with them! So sorry especially to have\n",
      "her miss seeing their new Y. W. building that had been planned \"in\n",
      "exact accordance with your own ideas, dear Mrs. Dunlap, and it is\n",
      "simply perfect. Do, Ralph, tell her how sorry you are not to be able to\n",
      "show her through it.\"Thus urged, Mr. Oliver succeeded in finding voice to say: \"Mrs. Dunlap\n",
      "understands, I am sure, better than I could tell her, how ready I am to\n",
      "do her bidding.\"Mrs. Dunlap got away by the noon train and took the night-express\n",
      "for the West, canceling all her engagements for the week; she had\n",
      "more important work to look after. Not telegrams, nor long distance\n",
      "telephones, nor even carefully written letters could serve her now. She\n",
      "must go in person to try to explain, as best she might, to that dear\n",
      "girl who was waiting at home to hear from one to whom she had given her\n",
      "trust, to prove him to her mother as \"good and noble!\"As she sped westward that afternoon the good woman prayed that she\n",
      "might be able to help save that sweet, periled life.MRS. SHELDON and her daughter Daisy were occupying easy chairs in their\n",
      "pleasant living-room, surrounded by all possible evidences of home\n",
      "comforts, and luxuries. But even a passing glance at the two faces\n",
      "would have suggested unrest. The mother's face looked worn, and her\n",
      "eyes were anxious; while the daughter's eyes were tense with excitement.\"Daisy dear,\" began Mrs. Sheldon, and was interrupted:\"Please, Mother, won't you call me 'Marguerite'?\"A look of pain flushed the mother's face but she spoke quietly.\"Why, daughter, you know I nearly always say 'Daisy.'\"\"I know you do; but I—I don't like it to-night; I—Mother, I just can't\n",
      "bear the sound of it! That's the only explanation I can give.\"Unshed tears were in the mother's eyes. \"I will try to remember,\" she\n",
      "said, her voice low and tremulous. \"But you are my 'Daisy' you know;\n",
      "all I have left in this world; and your father loved that name.\"Daisy with a sudden movement flung herself on the arm of the great easy\n",
      "chair and hid her face in her mother's neck; when she tried to talk her\n",
      "voice choked with sobs.\"Oh, Mother, do please try to understand; you know what Father was to\n",
      "me, and you surely know that I love you with all my soul. If I hadn't,\n",
      "I—\"But the convulsive sobs came again, and she once more hid her face,\n",
      "while the mother's arms clasped her tenderly. A few minutes passed,\n",
      "then the girl sat erect and tried again.\"Mother dear, forgive me.\" As she spoke, she slipped to the footstool\n",
      "beside her mother's chair. \"I didn't mean to worry you. I don't often\n",
      "go to pieces in this way, do I? But—you can't understand what I am\n",
      "going through! It seems so strange not to hear a word after almost five\n",
      "days! I thought I should certainly get a telegram, at least! Mamma, I\n",
      "didn't mean that about my name; at least not in the way it must have\n",
      "sounded. I shall get over that feeling, of course; but you see he did\n",
      "not know me by any other name; and when you used it, for a second it\n",
      "almost seemed as though I could hear his voice, and oh, Mother, I\n",
      "couldn't bear it! I spoke right out, before I thought.\"Mother, it seems as though you must understand what I mean! Don't you\n",
      "know you told me about how you loved Father so very much even right at\n",
      "the first? That is the way I feel about Rufus. Mother, I love him with\n",
      "all my soul, and I always shall! I never before knew what love meant,\n",
      "that kind of love, I mean and I can't tell you how it almost kills me\n",
      "to think that you don't believe in him!\"But you know you have hardly seen him. You have just let yourself be\n",
      "prejudiced by those horrid women who gossiped about him; just because\n",
      "he, was polite and helpful to those little flappers who were traveling\n",
      "alone; he showed them the same attention that any gentleman would. But\n",
      "I don't blame you, Mother dear; I suppose it is natural for mothers to\n",
      "feel so; when you never have had a chance to find out for yourself what\n",
      "a wonderful man he is. Besides, think how I helped it along!\"Why, mother, when I think of the way I let that awful Mrs. Dunlap, a\n",
      "perfect stranger, manage me so that I almost insulted him, it makes me\n",
      "feel as though I were going insane! Oh, I hope I shall never see or\n",
      "hear of her again! How could I let her make me treat him so! I don't\n",
      "see how he can ever forgive me! O, Mother! How can I live any longer! I\n",
      "wish I could die to-night!\"It was just then that the sound of the door bell pealed through the\n",
      "quiet house. The sound had instant effect on the nerves of the half\n",
      "insane girl. She sprang up quickly, evidently making a supreme effort\n",
      "at self-control, and spoke in a more natural tone.\"I'm afraid that's Nelson! I entirely forgot that he was to come\n",
      "to-night if he got back in time, to tell me how the vote went; as if I\n",
      "cared how they voted!\"With this last word, her voice had returned to bitter sarcasm; but\n",
      "after a moment she continued more quietly.\"Will you see him, Mother, and tell him tell him anything you like?\n",
      "I simply cannot talk with him to-night; nor with anybody else. Oh,\n",
      "Mother, kiss me and let me run away!\"By this time the poor mother had no words to offer about anything.\n",
      "She put her arms around her daughter, kissed her tenderly and opened\n",
      "the door for her to escape by way of the back hall, just as the maid\n",
      "appeared at the sitting-room doorway, card tray in hand.\"For Miss Daisy, ma'am. Has she gone upstairs? Shall I take it up to\n",
      "her room?\"\"No,\" said the weary, faithful mother. \"Daisy does not feel able to see\n",
      "callers to-night; I'll attend to it.\"She held out her hand for the card and read on it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. J. C. Dunlap, Albany.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dunlap!\" Over that name the face of the mother flushed, then paled.That was the name of the woman who had watched over her darling with\n",
      "such wise and patient care, and brought her safely home! Could it\n",
      "possibly be the same woman who was waiting in the parlor! If so, how\n",
      "could she talk with her just now? She felt completely exhausted. Still,\n",
      "Daisy certainly must not be called. She reminded herself that the name\n",
      "Dunlap was common enough, even though she did not happen to recall it\n",
      "among her acquaintances. It really was not at all probable that a woman\n",
      "who lived hundreds of miles away should suddenly appear late in the\n",
      "evening to make a call!At last she crossed the hall and opened the living-room door. One\n",
      "glance sufficed; the woman who arose at her entrance was the same one\n",
      "who had kissed Daisy goodbye with unmistakable tenderness only a few\n",
      "days before!\"I'm afraid I have startled you,\" said Mary Dunlap moving forward; for\n",
      "Daisy's mother had paused suddenly the moment she caught sight of her\n",
      "caller, and her pale face was expressive of pain. \"Of course you did\n",
      "not expect to see me so soon again, but I—it became my duty to return\n",
      "West sooner than I had planned. I hope I may see your daughter for a\n",
      "few minutes? There is a—I have heard of—something connected with our\n",
      "journey together, that she, perhaps, ought to be told.\"It was a very hesitating sentence; the speaker's tone and manner\n",
      "suggested embarrassing uncertainty as to just what she should do next.\n",
      "Something helped the mother to self-control and decision. Whatever that\n",
      "woman thought she ought to tell Daisy ought to be told! She believed in\n",
      "her! She might be mistaken in judgment, of course; unduly alarmed about\n",
      "a small matter; all people were liable to mistakes, occasionally. But\n",
      "she was sincere! Of that, Mrs. Sheldon felt absolutely sure; and what\n",
      "she had to say might help to clear away some anxieties. She held out\n",
      "her hand and spoke cordially.\"I am glad to see you again, Mrs. Dunlap, but I am afraid that my\n",
      "daughter will not be able to do so, this evening; she has had a\n",
      "somewhat trying day and is feeling to-night as though she could not\n",
      "talk with anybody. She seems nervously unstrung with her recent\n",
      "experiences. She has retired, I think, but perhaps you will trust me\n",
      "with a message?\"Mrs. Dunlap reached a quick decision. \"Perhaps I had better tell you\n",
      "all about it,\" she said, speaking as an intimate friend might have\n",
      "done. \"I have taken a room at the Delport House, and shall not leave\n",
      "until sometime to-morrow afternoon I think. If Daisy is feeling better,\n",
      "I could see her in the morning. I hope you will pardon my interest in\n",
      "your daughter and my familiar use of her name. She and I grew quite\n",
      "intimate during that one day you know.\"The mother's quick thought was, \"What would she think if she knew that\n",
      "I had just been told to say 'Marguerite!'\"Mary Dunlap, noting the troubled glance of the mother hurried on:\"I had a precious little girl of my own, once, about your daughter's\n",
      "age, Mrs. Sheldon. She was my only child. That night when your daughter\n",
      "stayed with me in my room was the first time I had ever been able to\n",
      "say with my whole heart, 'Thank God my Margaret is forever safe in the\n",
      "Everlasting arms!'\"That is my apology for intruding on you again. And now, perhaps it\n",
      "would be wiser for me to have my talk with you, leaving you to repeat\n",
      "as much or as little as you see fit, to your daughter.\"Mrs. Sheldon answered quickly, excitedly: \"Oh, I wish you would!\" she\n",
      "said, \"I have so longed to see you and ask you a lot of questions.\n",
      "Won't you sit down? And please, tell me first, about that night at the\n",
      "hotel. I know so very little about it, and I want to understand exactly\n",
      "what happened. Daisy is very vague in her story, and is so excitable\n",
      "that I dare not question her in her present state. All that I now know\n",
      "positively is that because of crowded conditions at the hotel, you\n",
      "kindly permitted her to share your room for the night.\"\"Is it possible that you have not been told the whole story!\" exclaimed\n",
      "Mary Dunlap in amazement. It seemed incredible that such a girl as the\n",
      "one she had protected had kept her mother in ignorance of the whole of\n",
      "that night's happenings.\"Oh, tell me quickly!\" said the mother, with instant premonition,\n",
      "dropping down on the edge of the couch where the caller had seated\n",
      "herself. \"Tell me all, please. I have been utterly at a loss to\n",
      "understand Daisy's unstrung state of mind.\"Mary Dunlap wondered wildly where she should begin and then plunged\n",
      "into her subject.\"First, may I ask, please, about this Mr. Keller whom I met that night\n",
      "with your daughter? Of course I knew nothing of him whatever. Is he a\n",
      "personal acquaintance of yours? A—friend?\"There was an instant flash of indignation in the mother's eyes.\"Certainly not!\" she replied with almost haughtiness in her voice. \"I\n",
      "have met him but once and I have never liked anything that I have heard\n",
      "about him. He is a sort of a traveling agent I believe for some New\n",
      "York firm, and business seems to call him to this particular town more\n",
      "frequently than I could wish. My daughter thinks that I am prejudiced\n",
      "against him because of certain stories we have heard about him, which\n",
      "she thinks have no foundation except in malicious gossip. But frankly,\n",
      "he is a source of much anxiety to me.\"For the past few months he has been quite attentive to Daisy, that\n",
      "is, as attentive as circumstances would allow, and I—do not trust him.\n",
      "I do not know why. But I don't! I am utterly at a loss to account for\n",
      "the influence he seems to have acquired over her in the few brief\n",
      "meetings they have had. She thinks me hard and cruel because I well, I\n",
      "can scarcely bear the sound of his name! And yet I have to confess that\n",
      "I have no good reason to offer for such a feeling. It appears that he\n",
      "really asked her to marry him. The idea is so obnoxious to me that I\n",
      "can scarcely bear to utter the words!\"\"And this trip they were taking together,\" ventured the troubled\n",
      "questioner; \"you knew about it of course?\"\"Trip!\" exclaimed the mother indignantly. \"They were not traveling\n",
      "together! Why, I sent her away on this visit to get her out of his\n",
      "vicinity because I heard that he was intending to remain in this\n",
      "town several weeks! They simply met on the train. Daisy thinks it\n",
      "was a coincidence I suppose from what she says, but of course, he\n",
      "followed her. I am positive of that. To put it plainly, he seems to\n",
      "be infatuated with her. And she, poor child, has admitted to me this\n",
      "very afternoon that she loves him with all her heart! Oh, it seems so\n",
      "terrible for me to be telling this to you, a stranger, burdening you\n",
      "with my anxiety.\"Mrs. Sheldon wiped the tears away from her eyes, and struggled to keep\n",
      "more from falling. \"But you have been so kind to me and to Daisy, and\n",
      "there has been no one to whom I could go for advice.\"Mary Dunlap slipped an arm around the shoulders of the mother with\n",
      "strong reassurance.\"My dear!\" she said in her warm comforting strong voice, \"Just you cry\n",
      "if you want to, and don't worry about telling me. I'm used to helping\n",
      "mothers and girls. It is my job in life. And don't you worry. I'm going\n",
      "to help you, and I thank God I can. I'm glad too that you have told me\n",
      "this, for now I can speak frankly and tell you all I know. It is going\n",
      "to make things a lot easier to set right. And now, I've got to tell you\n",
      "the whole story.\"THE voice was low and tender in which she began her story of the\n",
      "afternoon on the train. She made it plain that she had been so busy\n",
      "with her writing that she scarcely noticed who got on the train until\n",
      "toward evening when her work was done. She had been barely conscious of\n",
      "the two who took the seat in front of her, had given them but a swift\n",
      "glance and decided that they were bride and groom; until her work was\n",
      "done and she had leisure to look around. And then almost at once she\n",
      "was fascinated by the lovely face of the girl in front of her.Mary Dunlap was quick to note the pleased relaxing of the troubled face\n",
      "as she said this, and the instant sympathy as she gave her own first\n",
      "impression of the man who was sitting beside the girl.But as the tale progressed showing how late the train was, with\n",
      "inevitable missed connections, the mother's eye kindled with gratitude.\"Oh!\" she interrupted, \"I'm so glad you were there! What would Daisy\n",
      "have done if you had not been. She is so unused to traveling alone!\"Mary Dunlap went on to tell of the apparent argument between the two\n",
      "in front of her, the discomfort on the face of the girl, and her own\n",
      "continued wonder that such a girl should apparently be married to a\n",
      "man so much older, and of such a type. The mother gave a little gasp\n",
      "of dismay as she realized that this fine Christian woman had actually\n",
      "thought her daughter was married to that man! But it was only the\n",
      "dismay she had felt before at the horrible thought of him, and the old\n",
      "resentment at the idea of his presuming to be intimate with her girl.Not until the story progressed to the point where Mrs. Dunlap stood\n",
      "before the hotel desk writing her own name in the registry and noted\n",
      "the names on the line just above her own, \"R. H. Keller and wife,\" did\n",
      "the mother grasp the full meaning of it all. Then she leaned forward\n",
      "with a quick little motion and caught at both the firm capable hands of\n",
      "her visitor, crying:\"Oh, Mrs. Dunlap! You don't mean it! You can't mean that he dared do a\n",
      "thing like that! The wretch! The—the—beast!\"Her eyes were full of tears again. She could not seem to be able to get\n",
      "words strong enough to express her horror and disgust.\"But of course my Daisy didn't know that!\" she said lifting up her head\n",
      "with a gleam of hope, though there was a sob in the end of her voice.\"Not until I told her, some time afterwards,\" said Mary Dunlap.\"You told her! She knows! And yet she could tell me to-day that she\n",
      "loves him! Oh! What shall I do?\"\"Wait, dear Mrs. Sheldon,\" said Mrs. Dunlap putting a detaining hand on\n",
      "the drooping shoulder. \"Love is a strange thing. It throws illusions\n",
      "over the object that turn it into something entirely different. You\n",
      "must remember that. Don't blame Daisy too much. She explained to me at\n",
      "once after her first startled look, that of course he had done that to\n",
      "protect her reputation, since they had been delayed and all their plans\n",
      "upset. She said that they had expected to reach San Fergus at midnight,\n",
      "and that a minister friend of Mr. Keller's was to have met the train\n",
      "and performed the marriage ceremony. She said that Mr. Keller had\n",
      "telegraphed ahead for the bridal suite to be reserved for them in the\n",
      "San Fergus hotel.\"\"My Daisy told you that!\"It was years before Mrs. Dunlap forgot the tone, and the look on that\n",
      "mother's face when she said those words. It was as if some one had\n",
      "suddenly taken from her everything that was worth while in life, as if\n",
      "she felt that all the years of tender rearing, and care of precious\n",
      "love and companionship between her and her child were suddenly wiped\n",
      "out in one great awful act of disloyalty and broken faith with her\n",
      "mother. Oh, there would be a reaction by and by when the mother would\n",
      "excuse, and forgive, and bleed over her darling; but this first blow\n",
      "was like the very severing of the life bond between them, and it was\n",
      "terrible to witness.Mary Dunlap felt that it was a pity that the girl had not had to suffer\n",
      "that look herself with full understanding of all that it meant to her\n",
      "wonderful little mother.\"My dear! I feel like a surgeon performing an operation, but you must\n",
      "know it all,\" said Mary Dunlap tenderly.\"Oh, yes, yes,\" breathed the mother sorrowfully. \"If there is more, go\n",
      "on. It seems as if nothing mattered if Daisy, my Daisy, would go to\n",
      "such lengths. Actually running away to get married!\"\"My dear friend, you must remember that she thinks she is very much in\n",
      "love, and that she feels that you have been deceived about her loved\n",
      "one. They were planning to send you a telegram immediately as soon\n",
      "as the ceremony was performed, and were counting confidently on your\n",
      "immediate change of feeling so soon as the inevitable step was taken.\n",
      "You must remember also that your daughter was greatly troubled even\n",
      "then, at the momentary deception.\"As the time drew near, and the delay became inevitable, she began\n",
      "to see the whole thing in more nearly its true light, and it caused\n",
      "her deep distress. So much so that when Mr. Keller left her for a few\n",
      "moments in the hotel parlor where we both were waiting for our rooms\n",
      "to be prepared, she utterly forgot my presence, and began walking up\n",
      "and down the room, and actually giving a little moan of distress. It\n",
      "was then that I dared to interfere and offer my sympathy and any help I\n",
      "could give.\"\"Oh, how can I ever thank you! How can I thank God enough for having\n",
      "sent you there!\" moaned the stricken mother.\"I think He did plan that I should be there,\" said Mary Dunlap\n",
      "reverently. \"I was scheduled to be far from there at that time, had\n",
      "important speaking engagements to fill, and could not understand why\n",
      "all my plans were frustrated, but it seems that the Father had need\n",
      "of a servant right there, and perhaps this was more important than\n",
      "any meeting I could have addressed. I began to feel so as soon as\n",
      "your Daisy turned to me so readily, so even eagerly, like the little\n",
      "flower-faced child that she is.\"I had no difficulty in getting her to tell me her trouble. She trusted\n",
      "me at once, and when I offered my room as a refuge for the night she\n",
      "accepted most eagerly. Even when I told her how she was booked in the\n",
      "registry, she did not turn from me, as I feared she might. Instead she\n",
      "seemed aghast for a moment; then her loyalty to her lover made her at\n",
      "once attempt to excuse him. However, that did not prevent her from\n",
      "begging me to take her to the room immediately, before he returned from\n",
      "his telegraphing. She seemed to actually fear his influence upon her\n",
      "and to know that her only safe course was to go while he was gone.\"\"Oh, my poor child!\" moaned the mother.\"She made it very plain that Mr. Keller had overpersuaded her to\n",
      "this marriage, and that while she could not bear to refuse him, she\n",
      "yet longed to wait until your consent could be obtained. Of course I\n",
      "advised her strongly that this was the only possible right course, and\n",
      "she seemed to agree with me.\"\"Yes, Daisy is very conscientious that is she was, before this came.\n",
      "But she seems to be infatuated with that man! She has at this moment\n",
      "more faith in him than in anyone else, I believe.\"\"Well, she was glad to get to my room then, at least,\" said the other\n",
      "woman. \"She even wanted the door locked, and when I started to go down\n",
      "and tell Mr. Keller that she was safe and comfortable for the night\n",
      "with a woman, she begged me to lock the door and take the key with me!\"\"And yet she can say she loves him, when she cannot trust him! And at\n",
      "such a time! Oh, my little girl!\"\"Dear friend, the human heart is a curious thing, and the devil has\n",
      "many illusions wherewith to deceive, you know.\"\"And did you actually go down and talk to that man? What a wonderful\n",
      "heaven-sent friend you proved to be!\"\"I did. I'm afraid I rather enjoyed the commission. You must remember I\n",
      "had been watching him in the train for several hours, and while he was\n",
      "most courteous and assiduous in caring for her, and did nothing that I\n",
      "could really put my finger on with which to find fault, I had acquired\n",
      "the same feeling toward him that you seem to have. I just could not see\n",
      "how that little flower of a girl could have married him. And of course\n",
      "when I talked with your daughter, finding out they were not married\n",
      "after having seen how he registered, my feelings were anything but\n",
      "lenient toward him.\"\"I should think so! But oh, my little girl! What would her father have\n",
      "said if he could have known she was to pass through a thing like this!\"\"Courage, dear sister. I am sure God means something lovely to come out\n",
      "of all this.\"\"How could that possibly be!\" moaned the mother, \"Oh, if she could have\n",
      "been spared any contact with a creature like that! It is so terrible to\n",
      "see her pass through such an experience. My little Daisy!\"\"Yes, but Mrs. Sheldon, think, if she did not have you in this trying\n",
      "time!\"Suddenly there occurred an interruption. The two women became aware\n",
      "that the maid had answered a ring at the door, and had let in someone\n",
      "who was standing in the doorway of the room where they were sitting.Mrs. Sheldon got up quickly, with a hasty dab at her wet eyelashes and\n",
      "went toward him.Mary Dunlap looked up to see a tall young man standing in the doorway\n",
      "with his hat in his hand, a grave questioning look upon his face. He\n",
      "had keen gray eyes, a crop of nicely groomed reddish curls, and he\n",
      "looked strong and young and dependable.\"Oh, Nelson!\" exclaimed Mrs. Sheldon, a kind of dazed relief in her\n",
      "voice, \"You came to see Daisy about that committee meeting, didn't you?\n",
      "Why—she—she wasn't feeling very well to-night, Nelson. She has retired.\n",
      "She had a headache. She asked me to excuse her.\"The grave eyes took on a look of anxiety.\"Daisy not well?\" he said as if that were an unheard of thing.\"I should have telephoned you not to come,\" apologized Mrs. Sheldon,\n",
      "\"but this friend of hers—this friend of mine—arrived just then, from\n",
      "out of town, and it slipped my mind. Let me introduce you to Mrs.\n",
      "Dunlap, Nelson. Mrs. Dunlap, Mr. Whitney.\"\"A friend of Daisy's?\" said the young man his grave eyes lighting\n",
      "pleasantly, and he stepped forward and grasped Mrs. Dunlap's hand,\n",
      "giving her a swift searching glance.\"I certainly am!\" said Mary Dunlap with a hearty handclasp.He lingered only a minute or two to leave a message for the daughter\n",
      "about what had happened at the committee meeting, but he gave another\n",
      "keen parting glance accompanied by a warming smile as he left, that\n",
      "made the stranger feel that he approved of her, and that he understood\n",
      "that she was in no wise the cause of the tears that he had seen on\n",
      "Daisy's mother's face.After he was gone, Mrs. Sheldon came back to her caller.\"Why couldn't it have been that young man?\" asked Mary Dunlap with a\n",
      "sigh!\"Oh, if it only could have been!\" sighed the mother. \"He is the dearest\n",
      "boy! My husband trusted him so. He has been Daisy's schoolmate and\n",
      "companion for years, and yet she could think she has fallen in love\n",
      "with that other creature!\"\"There, there, dear friend. I tell you the human heart is a mystery.\n",
      "And a girl at Daisy's age gets queer ideas sometimes. She will come out\n",
      "of it and be fine and beautiful. You see!\"\"Oh! I don't know!\" sighed the mother. \"She is so strange! Not even\n",
      "willing to see Nelson. She thought it was Nelson when you came, and\n",
      "rushed away telling me she would not see him nor anyone else to-night!\n",
      "I could not tell him that of course. He has been so kind and so\n",
      "devoted. And I can see that he is terribly worried about this Keller.\n",
      "He looks as if he would like to fight every time Daisy mentions his\n",
      "name. But tell me, what did the fellow do when you told him Daisy was\n",
      "going to remain with you for the night?\"\"Do? He was fairly insolent. He was furious. He told me to mind my\n",
      "own business. He strode around that parlor like a madman, till I told\n",
      "him Daisy had appealed to me for protection, and had told me she was\n",
      "not yet married to him; but that I had seen how he registered in the\n",
      "hotel. Then he calmed down a little and began to try to smooth things\n",
      "over. He tried to explain that he had done that merely to protect the\n",
      "girl, and that he intended to make everything right for her. He even\n",
      "came to the point, before we were done, of saying that perhaps he had\n",
      "been wrong in doing it, but he had followed an impulse when he wrote.\n",
      "Oh, you know how a man like that could lie himself out of anything! He\n",
      "even said that of course if Daisy preferred to be with me, it was all\n",
      "right, but he really must see her before she slept and arrange about\n",
      "his telegrams. Of course I saw through that. He knew his influence over\n",
      "her!\"So I told him she had asked not to be disturbed, and that she did not\n",
      "wish to see him again until she was at home with her mother and her\n",
      "mother knew all. Then he began to rave at me of course but I let him\n",
      "understand that I should not hesitate to call for assistance if he\n",
      "made further trouble, and I fancy he did not care for publicity, so he\n",
      "withdrew with what grace he could.\"\"And then?\"\"Well, strange to say we had no further trouble with him. I had looked\n",
      "up trains and found there was a very early one. Perhaps he was asleep,\n",
      "although I was taking no chances. I decided to stay by till I placed\n",
      "her safely in her mother's care.\"\"You have been wonderful!\" said the mother. \"I can never thank you.\n",
      "And I'm glad too, that you came and told me all to-night. It has been\n",
      "very hard to hear, but it was right that I should know. Only, my dear\n",
      "new strong friend, I don't know what I am going to do. I am terrified\n",
      "at what may yet develop. I am sure that man will not be easily shaken\n",
      "off. He is probably only waiting till Daisy gets all strained up with\n",
      "anxiety, as she is now, when he knows she will be wax in his hands. I\n",
      "cannot believe he will give up so easily. He will know that you cannot\n",
      "linger around to protect always, and unfortunately, he is not afraid of\n",
      "me.\"\"My dear, wait until you have heard the rest of the story.\"\"Oh, is there more?\" The mother's face showed a new terror.She sat up tense and anxious clasping her frail hands in one another\n",
      "till the knuckles showed white.\"No, dear Mrs. Sheldon, don't be frightened,\" went on Mary Dunlap. \"I\n",
      "will try to be as brief as possible, but I am sure you should know\n",
      "everything.\"\"Oh, yes!\" implored the white lipped mother.Mary Dunlap's heart ached for her as she went on with the story:\"After I left Daisy with you that morning I went directly to New York\n",
      "where I was to be entertained by a Mrs. Oliver whom I had met a number\n",
      "of times in connection with my public work. She had often invited me to\n",
      "be her guest and talk over various matters with her, but I had never\n",
      "been able to arrange a definite date before. I arrived at midnight, and\n",
      "was taken almost at once to my room, seeing none of the family that\n",
      "night except my hostess.\"But the next morning at breakfast I was introduced to her two lovely\n",
      "daughters, and a moment later to her husband who had arrived a few\n",
      "moments before on an early train from the West. Perhaps you can imagine\n",
      "my horror when I looked up to greet him, and found that the man to whom\n",
      "Mrs. Oliver was introducing me, calling him 'her husband Mr. Oliver,'\n",
      "was the Mr. Keller from whom your daughter had been rescued a few\n",
      "nights before!\"Mary Dunlap had told the end of her story rapidly, conscious that her\n",
      "listener was under a heavy strain, and now she looked up with relief\n",
      "that all was told.But the poor mother had borne all she could. She suddenly drooped and\n",
      "would have fallen if the caller had not put strong arms about her and\n",
      "laid her gently on the couch.\"My dear!\" she said as she stooped over the poor sufferer and patted\n",
      "her gently. \"My dear! Don't feel so terribly about it. I am sure this\n",
      "part of the story should be a relief, for it certainly puts that man in\n",
      "a position where he dare not touch your daughter again!\"\"But oh, to have my Daisy, my baby, mixed up with a man like that!\"\n",
      "wailed the utterly crushed little mother, \"It seems as though I never\n",
      "can lift my head again!\"\"Oh, my dear! That is a very small part of the whole matter. The main\n",
      "thing is that no harm shall come to the child. No one here knows, of\n",
      "course, and he has promised!\"But a new voice broke in the room, clear and ringing and cold like a\n",
      "young Nemesis. \"What are you doing to my mother? Have you come here to\n",
      "make more trouble for us? Who are you, anyway?\"THE girl stood in the doorway, her eyes flashing like blue flames, her\n",
      "delicate profile outlined against the rich portier, chin lifted, in\n",
      "scorn, the light catching the glint of the waves in her pretty hair and\n",
      "turning them into gold, the delicate blue of her silk kimono bringing\n",
      "out the pearly tint of her skin, a haughty little patrician, insolent\n",
      "in her loveliness.Mary Dunlap looked at her in pity, and admiration, and a rising wonder.\n",
      "Was this the girl who had melted to tears in her arms but a few nights\n",
      "before, and implored her to protect her? How lovely she was even in\n",
      "her frenzy. She made a picture as she stood there in her rightful\n",
      "background. Poor, misguided infant! What a hard road she had set her\n",
      "feet to travel, and how soon she must come to humiliation.But the mother was shocked into severity. \"Marguerite!\" she said,\n",
      "sitting bolt upright and looking at her daughter sternly, as she had\n",
      "not looked at nor spoken to her since she was a very little girl,\n",
      "\"Marguerite! You forget yourself! You are beside yourself. Apologize\n",
      "at once to Mrs. Dunlap. You do not know what you are doing! Mrs.\n",
      "Dunlap is the best friend you have in this world. She has gone to\n",
      "great inconvenience and expense and trouble to save you from an awful\n",
      "calamity!\"The Marguerite of a few days ago would have been crushed to earth by\n",
      "such words from her beloved mother. Not so the girl of that night. She\n",
      "did not even wince. Instead she drew herself up to her full height\n",
      "and looked her mother steadily in the eyes, as if their ages had been\n",
      "reversed, and spoke with a certain air of authority that was almost\n",
      "startling.\"No, I am not beside myself, Mother! It is you who do not know what\n",
      "you are doing. You have allowed yourself to be blinded by an utter\n",
      "stranger. You have swallowed whole the lies she has handed out to\n",
      "you. Mother, I understand it all now. This woman is a rank imposter,\n",
      "employed by others to ruin the reputation of a prominent and successful\n",
      "business man, in order to extort money from him. Oh, I have heard a\n",
      "lot that she has been saying! Don't try to stop me. Isn't this kind of\n",
      "thing being done every day now? The daily papers are full of it. Why,\n",
      "even novels are just full of plots like that.\"Didn't that horrid woman whose latest book is being lauded in every\n",
      "column of reviews make one of her characters boast of being a daughter\n",
      "of Eve to some purpose because she had told some successful lies about\n",
      "one of her victims? I tell you, Mother, you don't know the world. Times\n",
      "have changed since you were a girl. You think every woman is good,\n",
      "simply because she is a woman and dresses respectably. That is why you\n",
      "are willing to believe all these terrible things about Rufus, and why\n",
      "you want me to believe them. Just because a woman has told you. Just\n",
      "ask her how much she is to be paid to bring about his ruin. Ask her\n",
      "that! Do you suppose she is to be paid whether she succeeds or not?\n",
      "It must be she isn't; that is why she is so persistent, sneaking in\n",
      "to tell tales to you when I'm not by, and get you on her side. She\n",
      "evidently is afraid she is going to lose her money!\"\"Marguerite! Oh, my poor child!\" exclaimed the mother in horror,\n",
      "beginning to cry. \"Oh, Mrs. Dunlap, I beg you will forgive her. She\n",
      "doesn't know what she is saying.\"\"That is perfectly all right, Mrs. Sheldon, don't think of it for a\n",
      "moment. I understand.\"But the girl's voice broke in scornfully:\"I certainly do know what I am saying. I understand it all perfectly. I\n",
      "can see the plot clearly now. I remember how this woman sat behind us\n",
      "in the cars, doubtless of purpose, listening to us. She was writing all\n",
      "the afternoon. I suppose she took down our private conversation. She\n",
      "probably carries on such business constantly, and chooses her victims\n",
      "among those who look as if they would care about their reputations and\n",
      "have plenty of money to hush up such tales. That is called blackmail,\n",
      "Mother, and I've read quite a lot about it in the papers. But they\n",
      "are not going to frighten us. Rufus and I will search this thing out\n",
      "to the foundations and make it impossible for this woman ever to get\n",
      "in her deadly work on any other good Christian man. It would be even\n",
      "worth sacrificing ourselves if we could do that. It is because people\n",
      "are afraid that they succumb to such things as this. We are not afraid!\n",
      "This woman listened to our plans and discussions, and knew just where\n",
      "to get us, that is all. If I hadn't been such a fool, I would have\n",
      "understood at the time, and I shouldn't have yielded to the spell she\n",
      "cast over me. She must be a hypnotist. She somehow succeeded in making\n",
      "everything look different from what it really is. But she can't do it\n",
      "again. I've got my eyes open!\"These are a few of the indignant sarcasms that the two long-suffering\n",
      "women had to listen to as the evening passed on. Mrs. Sheldon,\n",
      "mortified to the extreme of agony over the way her daughter was raving\n",
      "out against the wonderful woman who had saved her from a life of\n",
      "humiliation; alarmed beyond measure for the sanity of the one who was\n",
      "dearer to her than life, roused from her own weakness and tried every\n",
      "possible means to bring the girl to reason, all to no purpose.At last Mary Dunlap who had stood by helpless, trying to think of\n",
      "something she might say which would bring the girl to her senses,\n",
      "leaned over toward the mother and said in a low tone:\"Suppose I just go away for the night now. She is excited and the sight\n",
      "of me only irritates her. If she could get some sleep she might be more\n",
      "reasonable in the morning. No, don't get up. I can find my own way to\n",
      "the door. You can telephone if you need me. I shall stay close to my\n",

      "began to pace the floor, the very personification of indignant fury.After she had exhausted herself with wild words, she suddenly flung\n",
      "herself down before her mother with her head in her mother's lap and\n",
