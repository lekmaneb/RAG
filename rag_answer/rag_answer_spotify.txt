do i need to pay to use Spotify?


Answer:
Yes. To use the Spotify Service, you must purchase a Paid Subscription. You can purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party. Direct prepaid charges to Spotify for a Paid Subscription terminated by Spotify prior to the end of the Prepaid Period will be refunded within the Prepaid Period for any unused portion of the Paid Subscription.
To continue using the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect, you will receive the new price. If you do not agree to a price change, you have the right to object to the change by leaving the applicable Paid Subscription before the fee change takes effect.
