Artist: Ed Sheeran ; Title: Don’t ; Lyric: i met this girl late last year she said don't you worry if i disappear i told her i'm not really looking for another mistake i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait but then i jumped right in a week later returned i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn but i gave her my time for two or three nights then i put it on pause until the moment was right i went away for months until our paths crossed again she told me i was never looking for a friend maybe you could swing by my room around ten baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin we'll be in between the sheets till the late am baby if you wanted me then you should have just said she's singing   don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe   and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza before a text message was the only way to reach her now she's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her singing out aretha all over the track like a feature and never wants to sleep i guess that i don't want to either but me and her we make money the same way four cities two planes the same day and those shows have never been what it's about but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch but we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now wish i'd have written it down the way that things played out when she was kissing him how i was confused about now she should figure it out while i'm sat here singing   don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe   knock knock knock on my hotel door i don't even know if she knows what for she was crying on my shoulder i already told ya trust and respect is what we do this for i never intended to be next you bastard but you didn't need to take him to bed that's all and i never saw him as a threat you bastard until you disappeared with him to have sex of course it's not like we were both on tour we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment but it was never just fun and i thought you were different this is not the way you realised what you wanted it's a bit too much too late if i'm honest and all this time god knows i'm singing   don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe

the back of the ac' backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin' that i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs feel my wrath of attack rappers are havin' a rough time period here's a maxi pad it's actually disastrously bad for the wack while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce   'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god rap god all my people from the front to the back nod back nod now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard that hard everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like ι have got   well to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance everybody loves to root for a nuisance hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew mcs get taken to school with this music 'cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme now i lead a new school full of students me i'm a product of rakim lakim shabazz pac nwa cube hey doc ren yella eazy thank you they got slim inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position to meet rundmc induct them into the motherfuckin' rock and roll hall of fame even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame on the wall of shame you fags think it's all a game

racin' around the track call me nascar nascar dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god kneel before general zod this planet's kryptonno asgard asgard   so you'll be thor and i'll be odin you rodent i'm omnipotent let off then i'm reloadin' immediately with these bombs i'm totin' and i should not be woken i'm the walkin' dead but i'm just a talkin' head a zombie floatin' but i got your mom deepthroatin' i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothin' in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad 'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin' to a man while he played piano man oh man that was a 47 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed jj fad uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin' i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retardbe a king think not why be a king when you can be a god

preferably shake the world up if it were up to me paul wants me to chill y'all want me to ill i should eat a pill probably i will old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death i breathe on the mirror i don't see my breath possibly i'm dead i must be possessed like an evil spell i'm evil evil spelled jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick stick it in a vise grip hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch like vice president mike pence back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip these are things that i'd rather do than hear you on a mic since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and jesus christ man how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch fuck my side chick you won't ever see em icy but as cold as i get on the mic i polarize shit so the thames might freeze and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it bitch i got the club on smash like a nightstick yeah turn down for what i ain't loud enough nah turn the valium up illa illa illa 'cause i don't know how i'm gonna get your mouths to shut now when it doesn't matter what caliber i spit at i'll bet a hundred thousand bucks you'll turn around and just be like man how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks and now he wants to take it out on us ooouuu but last week an exfan mailed me a copy of the mathers lp to tell me to study it'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me ooouuu i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that i'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry especially an effing recovery clone of me nfing so fingerbang chicken wang mgk igg' azae' lil pump lil xan imitate lil wayne i should aim at everybody in the game pick a name i'm fed up with bein' humble and rumor is i'm hungry i'm sure you heard rumblings i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach i heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbojumbo the era that i'm from will pummel you that's what it's comin' to what the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it i'm gonna crumble you and i'll take a number two and dump on you if you ain't joyner if you ain't kendrick or cole or sean then you're a goner i'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonald's but if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get revival but y'all are actin' like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned and you woulda bought it but sayin' i no longer got it 'cause you missed a line and never caught it 'cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it 'cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but you'll never be an artist and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what i'll never be is flawless all i'll ever be is honest illa illa illa even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i don't see why y'all even started with me i get in beefs my enemies die i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased i'm east side never be caught slippin' now you see why i don't sleep not even a wink i don't blink i don't doze off i don't even nod to the beats i don't even close my fuckin' eyes when i sneeze aw man that bet cypher was weak it was garbage the thing ain't even orangeoh my god that's a reach shout to all my colorblind people each and everyone of y'all if you call a fire engine green aquamarine or you think water is pink dawg that's a date  looks like an olive to me look there's an apple  no it's not it's a peach so fingerbang pootie tang burger king gucci gang dookie dang charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesn't matter what i say give me donkey of the day what a way for 08 to get underway but i'm gonna say everything that i wanna say welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah invite 'em in like a one a day i'm not done preach 'cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it 'cause the way i see people turning's makin' it seem worthless it's startin' to defeat the purpose i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined 'cause i'm determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back i'd at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted but i think it's workin' these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous and he's too scurred to answer me with words 'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he's heard it 'cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him or ask if i'm linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis 'cause they've been pannin' my album to death so i've been givin' the media fingers don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they've been puttin' me through the ringer so i ain't ironin' shit out with the press but i just took this beat to the cleaners
